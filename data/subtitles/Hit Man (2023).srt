1
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,020
So, what does Nietzsche mean when he says,

2
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:06,541
"The secret for harvesting from existence

3
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:09,167
the greatest fruitfulness,
the greatest enjoyment

4
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:11,249
is to live dangerously!

5
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,708
Build your cities
on the slopes of Vesuvius!

6
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,749
Send your ships into uncharted seas!

7
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,875
Live at war with
your peers and yourselves!"

8
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:21,792
What is he getting at here?

9
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,375
Anybody?

10
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:27,833
Sylvia.

11
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:31,458
It sounds like he's saying you have to
put yourself out there.

12
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,542
You have to take risks
and get out of your comfort zone

13
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:37,707
because life is short.

14
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:41,083
You have to live passionately
and on your own terms.

15
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:44,333
Well, I have
a three-word response to that.

16
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:46,457
Ab-so-lutely.

17
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:49,542
Says the guy driving a Civic.

18
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:43,333
<i>I know on the surface
my life looks simple, a little plain.</i>

19
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:46,875
<i>A guy feeding birds
and living alone with his cats</i>

20
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:50,417
<i>in the suburbs, but I liked my inner life.</i>

21
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,167
<i>I was pretty happy.</i>

22
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:54,958
<i>...At least, content.</i>

23
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:59,354
<i>Oh, by the way, my name is Gary Johnson,
and for a few years,</i>

24
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:02,542
<i>I'd been teaching psychology
and philosophy classes</i>

25
00:03:02,543 --> 00:03:04,208
<i>at the University of New Orleans.</i>

26
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:09,083
<i>While I'd always enjoyed
living in a world of questions and ideas,</i>

27
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:12,875
<i>I also had a flair for all
things electronic and digital</i>

28
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:15,499
<i>and found myself supplementing my income</i>

29
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,208
<i>- by working part-time undercover...</i>
- Hey, Gary!

30
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,208
<i>...with the New Orleans Police Department.</i>

31
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,332
<i>After some obligatory training,</i>

32
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,750
<i>I was soon hiding cameras, mics,
and getting good recordings,</i>

33
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:29,250
<i>mostly in murder-for-hire cases.</i>

34
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,541
<i>What can I say?</i>

35
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:36,083
<i>I was minding my own business
when my life took the oddest of turns.</i>

36
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:49,208
Jasper better watch
his ass with this Craig guy.

37
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,792
Several assault charges, possession...

38
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,582
Hey, Gary.

39
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,958
Look, we just heard. Jasper can't go in.

40
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,333
Chief officially suspended him
for those teenagers he jacked up.

41
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:02,374
Finally.

42
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,042
Anyway, we're thinking you're up.

43
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:08,082
I'm up? What is "up"?

44
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,583
Congrats, Gary, you just got
promoted to contract killer.

45
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,167
Oh, well, you reschedule.

46
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,374
He's not even here yet.

47
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,292
Hitmen don't cancel the first meeting.

48
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:22,542
Hitmen?

49
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:25,041
Hitmen don't exist.

50
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:26,750
What, are we following
made-up rules now?

51
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,417
You've seen this a million times.
You can do it.

52
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:30,624
Why don't you do it?

53
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,125
No way. Tried years ago,
almost got killed.

54
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,083
I don't want to almost
get killed either. Okay?

55
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:38,395
I'm a civilian.

56
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:39,707
We got your back.

57
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,000
We'll move in if it starts
getting pear-shaped.

58
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:46,645
Clock's ticking,
I need you to grab Jasper's wire.

59
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:48,750
And you might want to
check this out real quick.

60
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:51,042
That is everything we know so far, Billy.

61
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,478
- What?
- Your alias.

62
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:55,125
"Billy." Let's go.

63
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,667
<i>Oh, my God, I'm gonna die.</i>

64
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:15,041
What a bunch of cancel culture bullshit...

65
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:18,499
I'm sorry about this, Jasper.
So, Claude sent me to...

66
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,417
You know, a lot of people were fine
with what I did, given the circumstances.

67
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:25,582
They actually had no problem with it.

68
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:30,042
If you read the comment section,
it's like two-to-one my side.

69
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,958
That sucks.

70
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:35,291
Fuck 'em.

71
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:40,124
A 120-day suspension with pay. Fuck.

72
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:44,542
Fuckin' fine with me.
I'm going fishin', motherfuckers.

73
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:47,624
I'll spend the whole summer in Pensacola.

74
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,500
See how everyone around here
does without me.

75
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,583
Why are you in my car?

76
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,583
Well, Claude said to get
your mic and transmitter.

77
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:00,083
So, who's going in my place?

78
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,208
You?

79
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:08,833
Right?

80
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:09,875
Wow.

81
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,625
I just feel like
there's better candidates.

82
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:14,917
Yeah, yeah.

83
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,791
Eh... makes sense.

84
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:23,750
You have this unreadable face,
perfectly forgettable.

85
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:25,042
I know.

86
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:28,437
So, I've been listening
on these for a while.

87
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:30,583
You know, I kinda know what to say, but...

88
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:33,207
any wisdom? Or tricks?

89
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:37,332
Bottom line, they gotta believe it. Okay?

90
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,457
They want you to be this killer,
so you gotta be that.

91
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:44,000
You can't show any weakness.
It's... it's constant aggression

92
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:46,042
until you hear the words
out of their mouth.

93
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:47,708
Got it.

94
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:51,041
But you gotta be relaxed.

95
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:53,666
Easy breezy.

96
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,374
All right, so, I'm looking for...

97
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,135
...like, I'm trying to...

98
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:02,582
Your job is to put
these assholes in prison.

99
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,125
- What's up, Claude?
<i>- New Billy's got to make moves.</i>

100
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:06,917
<i>- Craig's here.</i>
- All right.

101
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:09,166
Oh, man...

102
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:12,167
You only get one first impression.
Don't fuck it up.

103
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,930
You're not wearing those
in there, are you?

104
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,958
Honestly, these are pretty good, man.

105
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,583
They breathe really well.

106
00:07:25,584 --> 00:07:27,750
Yeah. Oh.

107
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,375
Hah!

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,895
You're Billy.

109
00:07:35,896 --> 00:07:37,791
You're a killer!

110
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,042
You kill...

111
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,042
for a living!

112
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,833
<i>Picked a bad table.
Grab your shit. Sit down.</i>

113
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:31,042
Listen, this whole thing's
gotta be based on trust.

114
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:33,750
Yeah, man.

115
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:35,708
No shit.

116
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,583
So, uh...

117
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,417
...how long you been doin' this?

118
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,167
That's none of your fuckin' business.

119
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,041
Oh, shit. Look at Gary.

120
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:50,292
<i>You called me to do a job.</i>

121
00:08:50,293 --> 00:08:51,916
The man is a natural.

122
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,999
Playing some offense here.

123
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,125
You don't know me, I don't know you,
and at some point in the future,

124
00:08:57,126 --> 00:08:59,041
that's gonna be a good thing.

125
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:01,875
We're not going to be friends. You got it?

126
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,083
Got it.

127
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,792
<i>Breathe... Think hitman thoughts.</i>

128
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:14,166
- So...
- So...

129
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16,082
...you're assessing me.

130
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:19,666
Am I the right guy
to eliminate your problem?

131
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:23,250
And, just so you know,
I'm assessing you, too.

132
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,667
Are you full of shit?

133
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:28,124
Some big talker who's not serious?

134
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,208
And if you are serious now,
are you one day gonna find Jesus

135
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:34,250
and be so overburdened
by guilt and remorse

136
00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:35,499
and confess your sins?

137
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,291
Are you gonna crack under pressure, Craig,

138
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:40,625
and are you gonna point
a fucking finger at me?

139
00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:42,312
Never!

140
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:43,999
Fuck, man, never.

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,542
In fact, I got it all worked out already.

142
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,125
Okay.

143
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,958
Let's hear it.

144
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,499
I work a seven and seven,

145
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,292
so starting this coming Tuesday,
which is crew-change day outta Houma,

146
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:06,167
every second of my whereabouts
is documented and accounted for.

147
00:10:06,168 --> 00:10:07,499
Huh?

148
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,792
That way, uh, anything, uh...
bad were to happen,

149
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,542
no one could think I did it, right?

150
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,582
Not Craig, uh-uh,

151
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,583
cause Craig is out
on an oil rig, isn't he?

152
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:26,625
A hundred and twenty miles out
in the Gulf the whole damn time.

153
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:29,625
What do you think about that?

154
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:30,958
That's a good plan.

155
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,249
Yeah.

156
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,125
All right, I'd say Thursday or Friday
is probably the best time.

157
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:38,791
Sounds good.

158
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:40,750
So, what are you thinking exactly?

159
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,291
You know, just take care of 'em?

160
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:47,250
What does that mean, exactly?

161
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:50,291
C'mon, man.

162
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:52,125
You know what it means.

163
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,875
No, he just needs to go away for good.

164
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,375
So, what's your proximity afterwards?

165
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,583
What do you mean?

166
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,542
Going to the funeral?

167
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:06,667
Funeral?

168
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,500
In my ideal world,

169
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:12,875
there wouldn't have to be
a funeral, would there?

170
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,375
So, no funeral?

171
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,292
Dude, I'm sorry, but...

172
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:18,791
Oh, boy.

173
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:21,125
<i>Are we actually talking about
the same thing here?</i>

174
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,978
Going off the rails here.
C'mon, let's get back on track, Gary.

175
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:28,051
<i>The reason I'm asking
is because it sounds to me</i>

176
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:31,125
<i>like you're talking about
the disposal of a body,</i>

177
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:33,042
which is more risky for me.

178
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:34,874
Gotcha... Yeah.

179
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:38,082
A faked suicide, botched robbery,
I'm in and out.

180
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:41,125
What you're talking about requires me
to spend a lot of time with the body

181
00:11:41,126 --> 00:11:42,583
to make sure it's never discovered.

182
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,625
Right. I'm just curious...

183
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,874
How you do that?

184
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,375
Look, I'll let you in
on a few of my secrets.

185
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:55,417
- Yeah.
- I got different ways, but...

186
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,207
in this case,

187
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,416
I'll probably go full on,

188
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:04,958
separate the head from the body,
do what I like to call a "bayou burial."

189
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,917
You know Bayou Gauche?

190
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:07,999
Sure do.

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,208
My family's got land out there,
so, late at night,

192
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:16,417
I'll drift in undetected,
drift out in a little boat,

193
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,958
let the alligators take it from there.

194
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,583
I mean, are we talking about the body...

195
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,000
or the head?

196
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:27,542
Body.

197
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,708
Head...

198
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,167
Head is a different story.

199
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,833
Head means teeth.

200
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,333
Teeth are a fuckin' problem.

201
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:40,167
Dental records, right?

202
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:41,916
Okay.

203
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,292
So, what do you do about that?

204
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,207
Well, I find a spot
in the middle of nowhere,

205
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,583
stick of dynamite in the mouth...

206
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:57,124
No more teeth, no more problem.

207
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,667
- You just blow that fucker up, huh?
- Mm.

208
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:00,750
Goddamn.

209
00:13:02,688 --> 00:13:03,750
Wow.

210
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,582
Hey, what about fingerprints, huh?

211
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:13,667
I mean, those are kinda like teeth, right?
I mean, they can identify from that?

212
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,166
What do you do about that?

213
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:18,208
I can tell you're very thorough
in your thinking,

214
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:19,250
- which is good.
- Hmm.

215
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,958
Now, in case the headless,
uneaten body is discovered,

216
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,292
which has never happened
with me, but, yeah...

217
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,332
no more fingertips.

218
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,417
I would have already removed those
and dispersed them separately.

219
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:37,625
Sounds kind of weird, but... I got a ritual.

220
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,124
So, I divide the number of miles
by the number of fingers,

221
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:46,437
so when I'm driving out to a location,
in this case 50 miles...

222
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:50,750
I roll down the window,
toss one out every five miles or so.

223
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:55,208
Just toss them fingers out the window...

224
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,999
Shit, man, you're the...

225
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,042
<i>you're the real deal, aren't ya?</i>

226
00:14:00,043 --> 00:14:01,646
<i>Yeah.</i>

227
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:03,249
And by the way,

228
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,417
I'm not running a fuckin' charity here.

229
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,666
Did you bring the cash?

230
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:11,708
Oh, shit, yeah. No, of course.

231
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:24,207
I've got, uh, 2,500, uh, cash now,

232
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:28,708
and, uh, I give you
the other 2,500 after, right?

233
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:32,500
Great.

234
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,833
Now, I just need
your absolute final sign-off.

235
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,457
We're entering a contract here

236
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,792
you won't be able to walk away from
in about a week.

237
00:14:39,793 --> 00:14:41,249
So, I need you to look me in the eyes,

238
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,375
and I need to hear the words
out of your mouth right now.

239
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:45,582
Chill. I just...

240
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,958
I just thought that we, you know,
agreed to it already, but, yeah.

241
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,750
Look man, I-I want you to off this guy

242
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,125
in... whatever way suits you best.

243
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:56,396
Got him.

244
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:57,666
I knew it.

245
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,125
We'll be in touch.

246
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,582
I gotta say, man,

247
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,583
hell of a profession you're in.

248
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:05,707
Yep.

249
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,667
The next time you see me,
you'll have a brand-new life.

250
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:10,917
I guess so.

251
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,958
Freeze! Put your hands up!

252
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,041
Go, go, go, go.

253
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:21,791
- What the fuck?
- Let me see your hands.

254
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,667
- Turn, let me see your hands.
- The fuck did I do?

255
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:26,082
Huh? Fuck! Fuckin' hands off...

256
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,582
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will

257
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,166
be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.

258
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,708
If you so desire, and cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you by the court.

259
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,332
- Do you understand these rights?
- Motherfucker.

260
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,583
I understand you should
go fuck yourself. How about that?

261
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,917
You got him. Good job.

262
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,874
Hey!

263
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,020
Okay, Daniel Day!

264
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:49,166
Nailed that fucker.

265
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:52,208
You got the cash, got the right
words out of him, sheesh!

266
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:53,749
- So that was good?
- Yeah!

267
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,416
You got him, man! Great job, Gary.

268
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:59,333
That was so smooth.
Who was that guy in there?

269
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,249
I don't know.

270
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,667
Open and fuckin' shut.
You might have just saved a life.

271
00:16:03,668 --> 00:16:04,791
How's that feel?

272
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:07,583
Feels good. Feels really good.

273
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,875
Hey, can I have my pants back now?

274
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:11,125
Yeah.

275
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,125
God, you guys are weird.

276
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,332
Hey, Gary.

277
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,499
Does your family
really have land out on the bayou?

278
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,667
Oh, no, I made that part up.

279
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:30,333
I have been out there a few times birding.

280
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:32,333
- Birding?
- Yeah.

281
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,124
You don't say?

282
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:38,042
You know, I once saw, uh, three
pileated woodpeckers at the same time.

283
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:39,792
Wh... Uh, pileated?

284
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:41,207
Yeah.

285
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:46,249
Just these big beautiful
kinda pterodactyl-looking guys.

286
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,917
Technically, it's the first cousin
to the elusive ivory-bill.

287
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:54,542
Which there was a rumored
sighting of back in 2005,

288
00:16:54,543 --> 00:16:56,249
first in over a hundred years.

289
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,792
Caused a big stir,
'cause most people think they're extinct,

290
00:16:58,793 --> 00:17:01,625
but others think
they might have just developed

291
00:17:01,626 --> 00:17:03,708
a successful strategy to avoid people.

292
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:06,250
Can we turn up the air, Phil?

293
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,583
Well, great work, Gary.

294
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:22,707
Yeah, man.

295
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,667
All right, bye.

296
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,167
Oh, jeez.

297
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:26,749
Bye.

298
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,374
Do you think he knows he was being funny?

299
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,291
I don't think so,
but it's hard to tell with Gary.

300
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:34,499
You know, that throwing fingertips
out the window every five miles...

301
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,208
- Who even thinks something like that up?
- That's some specifically twisted shit.

302
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:41,208
I mean, it's safe to say
we got our new hitman,

303
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:42,832
at least until Jasper gets back.

304
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:46,375
120 days, that's too soon, if you ask me.

305
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:48,625
Yeah, 'cause Jasper's a dick.

306
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,417
<i>You know, people feel
almost disappointed to learn</i>

307
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:55,332
<i>that hitmen don't really exist.</i>

308
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,749
<i>This idea that there are
people out there at a retail level</i>

309
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,041
<i>you can just hire to eliminate
your worst relationship issues</i>

310
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:06,374
<i>or facilitate some money scheme,
or the usual combination of both.</i>

311
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:10,707
{\an8}<i>It's a total pop culture fantasy.
But because hitmen</i>

312
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:15,332
<i>have been a staple of books,
movies, and TV for the last 50 years,</i>

313
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:19,250
<i>good luck getting anyone to believe
their existence is all a myth.</i>

314
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:22,375
<i>But of course, my job was
not to debunk the fantasy,</i>

315
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:24,333
<i>but rather become the fantasy.</i>

316
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,083
<i>And I took that part of the job
very seriously.</i>

317
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,332
<i>While I wasn't the kind of person
that could ever get worked up enough</i>

318
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:36,875
<i>to want to kill or die for anything,
maybe they had cast me correctly</i>

319
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:40,125
<i>because the one thing
that had prepared me for my new job</i>

320
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:41,791
<i>was my primary interest:</i>

321
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:45,583
<i>the eternal mystery of human
consciousness and behavior.</i>

322
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,750
<i>So, I, uh...
got your number...</i>

323
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,167
<i>from a friend.</i>

324
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,292
<i>Heard we should meet.</i>

325
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:59,083
<i>Sounds like you got a particular
set of skills and what not.</i>

326
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,624
<i>Uh... shit.</i>

327
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,792
<i>There was something else
I was supposed to say.</i>

328
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,749
<i>Well...</i>

329
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,125
<i>I'm sure you're picking up
my drift here of the nature of...</i>

330
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,124
<i>Anyway, just call me back.</i>

331
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,583
<i>My name's Walt.</i>

332
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:26,083
Uh...

333
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,000
How's the pie?

334
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,042
All pie is good pie.

335
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,083
All right.

336
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,042
So...

337
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,625
what's next?

338
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,041
<i>You know, I'm forever fascinated
and amazed by the folks</i>

339
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:50,791
<i>who actually think that some guy
they just met ten minutes ago,</i>

340
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:53,666
<i>for not that much money,
would risk the death penalty</i>

341
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:56,542
<i>to help them with some
crazy murderous scheme.</i>

342
00:19:58,042 --> 00:20:00,417
<i>I almost envy their naïveté and passion.</i>

343
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,792
<i>You know, it doesn't matter
who you asked about finding a hitman...</i>

344
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:07,916
So, you know I've, uh...
been looking for somebody

345
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:12,458
to help me out with a, uh...
little problem that I'm having lately.

346
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:15,917
I figured you knew somebody
in that line of work.

347
00:20:15,918 --> 00:20:17,750
I can ask around.

348
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:19,332
All right.

349
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,791
I don't know how serious he was,

350
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:25,166
but dude was hella sketchy.
And I was scared.

351
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:28,250
<i>The referral usually
finds its way to the police.</i>

352
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:30,292
<i>Who make sure they get my number.</i>

353
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:39,207
<i>You need to roll your tongue hard. Rrrrr...</i>

354
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,750
<i>I realized not everyone fantasized
about the same fixer.</i>

355
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:47,333
<i>So, I found tailoring the hitman
to the individual client</i>

356
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:49,416
<i>was much more effective.</i>

357
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:53,874
<i>And I had a knack for being
the person they needed me to be.</i>

358
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:57,124
<i>♪ I'm so fucked up
I see murders selling in the park ♪</i>

359
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:01,042
<i>We got our album coming up soon,
all the drama and everything from that</i>

360
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:03,041
<i>is only gonna be good for us.</i>

361
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:06,792
He beefin' with this cat
named Rob49, like this...

362
00:21:06,793 --> 00:21:08,957
He this real gangster motherfucker.

363
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,166
So, I feel like everybody
gonna figure, you know,

364
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:14,250
"that's his shit," you know, I'm thinking.
I'm gonna make sure I'm out of town,

365
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:16,374
so all you gotta do is come through...

366
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,542
Guy, I don't need your reasons

367
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,667
or your fuckin' business plan.

368
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,832
Give me the name and the money.

369
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,875
All right. Straight to business.
I like that.

370
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,792
<i>By the time
they were sitting down with me,</i>

371
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,666
<i>they'd mostly made up their minds.</i>

372
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:38,917
<i>They'd crossed that psychotic Rubicon
and just needed me to confirm</i>

373
00:21:38,918 --> 00:21:42,312
<i>that their darkest desires
were the right desires.</i>

374
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:45,708
If you come in the side entrance,
near the poolhouse,

375
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:47,208
there are no cameras.

376
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:51,666
Lady, this is quite the house.

377
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:54,583
And I'm not gonna let
that sumbitch take it from me.

378
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,541
You do your part...

379
00:21:57,542 --> 00:21:59,375
And I'll do mine.

380
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,333
Yes, ma'am.

381
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,666
And after he's gone,

382
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:07,833
I'll be in that big house all alone.

383
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,874
Big house?

384
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,292
Big house...

385
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,416
<i>Of course, I'd charge
a high society person more</i>

386
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:21,500
<i>just to seem more realistic,
but to me any payment was evidence,</i>

387
00:22:21,501 --> 00:22:24,375
<i>so I'd take whatever
they were able to give.</i>

388
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,458
It's not that much,
but you can have these, too.

389
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,042
Do you really wanna kill
your mom, Monte?

390
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:39,749
You're young.

391
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,917
You'll be making yourself an orphan.

392
00:22:41,918 --> 00:22:43,749
That's the point.

393
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,250
Did I ask your opinion?

394
00:22:46,251 --> 00:22:47,749
Kill the bitch.

395
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,208
<i>And they ended up giving
this little future school-shooter</i>

396
00:22:51,209 --> 00:22:53,208
<i>adjudicated probation.</i>

397
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:54,499
Okay, Boss.

398
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,791
<i>My would-be employers
ran the gamut.</i>

399
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:02,187
<i>Evenly divided between men and women,</i>

400
00:23:02,188 --> 00:23:04,583
<i>young and old, rich and poor.</i>

401
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:13,625
I like suicide. That seems clean.

402
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,735
Doesn't it?

403
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,124
That's the dream.

404
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,958
But a left-handed person
doesn't shoot themselves

405
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,957
with their right hand.

406
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:26,375
A person with a phobia
for heights doesn't jump.

407
00:23:26,376 --> 00:23:29,874
A well-tied noose requires studying.

408
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,292
Suicidal people
wanna leave this world quickly.

409
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:34,417
They don't want to explain themselves.

410
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:36,999
Neither do I.

411
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,542
Maybe... surprise me?

412
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,333
Sounds lovely.

413
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,708
See, I filed a mental health
warning against him a while back,

414
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:50,625
describing him as suicidal,
so it'll make sense to everyone.

415
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:54,875
Then I can sue his doctors
for malpractice.

416
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:56,625
You are smart lady.

417
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:02,250
I'm thinking, cut the wrists,
then hold him 'til he bleeds to death?

418
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:04,957
I am in service business.

419
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:08,833
I heard that was a fairly painless
way to go, bleeding to death.

420
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:13,041
Now, I don't have the kind of money

421
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:15,249
you were talking about
on the phone in cash,

422
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,292
but I have a deal
that'll be worth even more to you.

423
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,375
See.

424
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:29,667
You can have this boat,
but you can't sell it in Louisiana

425
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,374
'cause there's an insurance claim
against it.

426
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:36,292
But you take it over to East Texas,
Beaumont or Port Arthur...

427
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:38,875
I guarantee you'll get
at least 6,000 for it.

428
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:40,292
Speed boat.

429
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:44,542
Like <i>Miami Vice.</i>

430
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,917
Yeah! Like <i>Miami Vice.</i>

431
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:04,207
Believe me, we will get to
all of this eventually,

432
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:10,042
but let me jump in and pose a question
'cause I think it's going to be a lot of

433
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:13,082
what we're going to be
exploring this semester,

434
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:16,500
these concepts of personality,
self, and consciousness.

435
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:20,167
So, my simple question is...

436
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,708
How many of you think you know yourselves?

437
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,708
Have a strong sense of who you are?

438
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,792
Oh, come on, you don't know yourselves?

439
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,999
Of course you do.

440
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,792
Your entire being is invested
with this notion of self.

441
00:25:38,793 --> 00:25:41,250
It has to be for its own survival,

442
00:25:41,251 --> 00:25:43,708
but what we'll be doing this semester

443
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,167
is challenging this notion.

444
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:52,125
What if your "self" is a construction?

445
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,667
An illusion, an act,
a role you've been playing

446
00:25:56,668 --> 00:25:59,166
every day since you can remember?

447
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,832
<i>It's always a poignant moment</i>

448
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:03,667
<i>when your ex is having a kid
with someone else.</i>

449
00:26:03,668 --> 00:26:04,917
We'll see.

450
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:07,749
Seems like a pretty good class.

451
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,333
<i>I know many people
despise their exes,</i>

452
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:12,916
<i>but Alicia might have been my best friend.</i>

453
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:14,958
<i>Or at least the person that knew me best.</i>

454
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:16,707
If the "self" is a construct,

455
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:21,958
and it's all just role play,
do you think people can change?

456
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:26,062
Yeah, within our set-points,
which really isn't that much.

457
00:26:26,063 --> 00:26:29,582
Yeah, I don't know.
I was never really sure about that.

458
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,417
You know, there's actually been
a lot of recent research and data

459
00:26:32,418 --> 00:26:33,500
that says we can.

460
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:37,000
Enlighten me.

461
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:40,395
I've been reading a lot recently
about how researchers are finding

462
00:26:40,396 --> 00:26:43,125
that people can change their personalities
well into their adulthood.

463
00:26:43,126 --> 00:26:45,833
And, I mean, I'm working
with numerous clients on it.

464
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:48,250
All right. Define "change."

465
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:52,457
Okay. The five traits
that make up personality.

466
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:55,582
Right? Extroversion,
openness to experience,

467
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:58,332
emotional stability, agreeableness
and conscientiousness.

468
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,083
They can, they can all be altered
within just a few months.

469
00:27:01,084 --> 00:27:03,249
In what sense?

470
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:08,125
Well, I mean, you have to embody the trait
rather than just think about it.

471
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,957
You know, it's like the "as if" principle,

472
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:12,708
where you behave "as if" you are
the person you want to be,

473
00:27:12,709 --> 00:27:16,125
and then pretty soon
you might realize... that is you.

474
00:27:16,126 --> 00:27:20,041
The old you goes... where exactly?

475
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:23,875
Still there, just,
just dialed down significantly,

476
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:26,417
and the... the new you is dialed up.

477
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:31,583
So, you just didn't have a couple decades
to wait for me to change?

478
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:35,624
Well...

479
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,041
Uh...

480
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:39,417
if there was one thing
you seemed least interested in,

481
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:40,957
it was probably change.

482
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:45,250
I've accepted the idea
a normal relationship isn't in my cards.

483
00:27:45,251 --> 00:27:47,374
No. What is normal?

484
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:51,041
I mean, look at it this way,
everyone is at least a little fucked up.

485
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:53,999
You just need to find someone who is
a little fucked up in a way that you like.

486
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,958
Or at least, I don't know, in a way
that complements your own fucked-upness.

487
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,667
And that is a different
kind of survival technique

488
00:27:58,668 --> 00:28:01,042
that would involve another person.

489
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:04,833
Okay.

490
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:05,999
Okay.

491
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,707
Speaking of, um, fucked up,

492
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:14,833
I don't know, I thought you were just
doing tech support stuff for the police.

493
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:17,750
Now, you're like a full-blown
undercover murder-stopper?

494
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:19,167
Yeah.

495
00:28:19,168 --> 00:28:21,166
That's me.

496
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,166
I'm sorry, that must be so weird.

497
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:24,749
You know, I'm never
gonna give up teaching,

498
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,625
but this undercover thing
is like field research.

499
00:28:27,626 --> 00:28:28,749
How so?

500
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:33,542
Oh, man, you would not believe
the side of humanity I'm hanging out with.

501
00:28:33,543 --> 00:28:39,458
And a lot of it is seeing
how love has just curdled into hate,

502
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:42,333
and... murder is just the best way out.

503
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:45,874
Wow.

504
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:52,208
I have a feeling you never
wanted to murder me when we were married.

505
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:58,292
- You're saying it like it's a bad thing.
- Well, no, no. It's just an observation.

506
00:28:58,293 --> 00:29:01,041
I mean, to kill someone, I just imagine

507
00:29:01,042 --> 00:29:03,792
you'd have to be capable of
some serious passion.

508
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,374
I'm not incapable of passion.

509
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,833
For certain things, yes, definitely, but...

510
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,542
I think you should see someone.

511
00:29:14,543 --> 00:29:15,957
Like a therapist?

512
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:18,292
No, no. Like a, like a woman.

513
00:29:18,293 --> 00:29:19,958
Or whatever.

514
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,249
I have the loyal company of Id and Ego.

515
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,250
Okay. You need to see
a woman and a therapist.

516
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:36,417
I'm tellin' ya, I just don't think
it's the best use of my skills.

517
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:40,125
Just remember, Jasper,
if it weren't for the police union,

518
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:42,500
you wouldn't even have a job right now.

519
00:29:42,501 --> 00:29:43,916
Understood.

520
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:47,541
Uh, but now that I am back,
I should have my job back.

521
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:50,458
- You know, at least I'm trained for it.
- Um...

522
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:52,375
Maybe you hadn't heard
since you were on suspension,

523
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:54,541
but Gary's done a great job.

524
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,792
His conviction rate is high,
and quite frankly,

525
00:29:57,793 --> 00:29:59,417
he's got a better range than you do.

526
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,917
Do you believe that, Gary?

527
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,250
Do you guys think that's true?

528
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:14,957
Stats don't lie.

529
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:16,999
You don't like your position, Jasper?

530
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,791
Maybe I can find something
for you over in traffic patrol.

531
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:23,000
Well, shit. Why don't you just have me
clean the toilets around here, Sarge?

532
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:25,271
I-I could do that!

533
00:30:25,272 --> 00:30:27,541
Since you're being the asshole,

534
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:29,791
I'll just come right out and say it.

535
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:32,042
We're trying to hide your face, okay?

536
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:34,833
"Who's that beating up those teenagers?"

537
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,208
Not for no reason.

538
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,374
Maybe you've forgotten, Jasper,

539
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:41,166
unlike the nine million other
people who watched your video,

540
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:44,917
but we got an angry public out there,
and we don't want them in our business.

541
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:48,457
So, take my advice.

542
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:52,041
Do yourself and all of us a favor.

543
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:54,458
Lay low and keep your goddamn mouth shut.

544
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:56,208
Can you do that?

545
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:58,542
Anything else?

546
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:09,707
<i>Mother was Miss Del Rio.</i>

547
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:12,499
<i>They all moved to New Orleans
after Katrina.</i>

548
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,875
<i>Parents divorced,
no father in the picture.</i>

549
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,042
<i>Short stints hairdressing,
flight attendant.</i>

550
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,499
<i>Married to husband, Ray Masters,</i>

551
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,083
<i>works in his family's
oil and gas business.</i>

552
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,624
<i>Then...</i>

553
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,417
<i>...nothing.</i>

554
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,457
<i>No criminal record.</i>

555
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,375
<i>A couple of domestic complaints,
no arrests...</i>

556
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:39,083
<i>Huh.</i>

557
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:46,542
So, Madison...

558
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:52,500
...who is your hitman?

559
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:26,333
Are you enjoying your pie?

560
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:29,708
All pie is good pie.

561
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,041
Ron.

562
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:36,375
Madison.

563
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:52,083
So, tell me, Madison,
what do you do for a living?

564
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:54,354
Devoted wife.

565
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:55,916
Obviously.

566
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:58,208
I assume that's what
we're here to talk about.

567
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,208
Mm-hmm.

568
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,708
And to answer your question, um...

569
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:05,458
he doesn't let me work.

570
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,625
He doesn't really let me do anything.

571
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,708
Can I have a bite of that pie?

572
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:16,583
Sure.

573
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:19,292
He has me on this stupid diet.

574
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,500
Mm.

575
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,104
Oh, this is good.

576
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:30,500
Oh, he's cute.

577
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:34,333
You a dog person?

578
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,374
Do I look like a cat person?

579
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:40,500
Yeah. I don't really get cats.

580
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:41,917
Kinda creepy, you know?

581
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:43,792
Really?

582
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,000
Yeah, all those stories...

583
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,333
What stories?

584
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:52,208
The ones about, like, jealous cats
smothering babies, that kind of stuff.

585
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:53,874
Whoa.

586
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:56,249
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm sor... Um...

587
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,167
Do you know someone who's lost a child

588
00:33:59,168 --> 00:34:01,999
to a murderous, jealous cat?

589
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,833
I'm just trying to do
my fact-checking here.

590
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,666
- Not, like, personally.
- Okay.

591
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:08,458
But I've heard it from,
like, a lot of people.

592
00:34:08,459 --> 00:34:09,999
Well, then there you go.

593
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,167
We got to get to the bottom of this.

594
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:12,250
I agree.

595
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:13,333
Detective...

596
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:17,167
did we pull any paw prints off the victim?

597
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,832
No, sir, but we're herding suspects now.

598
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:24,125
No small challenge as we know.

599
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,875
Utter cat-astrophe.

600
00:34:28,876 --> 00:34:30,708
What?

601
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:34,583
Oh, you're good.

602
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:36,708
You, too.

603
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:43,917
So, what do you do?

604
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,292
Oh.

605
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:50,292
I'm sorry. I forgot.

606
00:34:50,293 --> 00:34:51,583
No, it's okay.

607
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,500
This is...

608
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:56,542
It's a lot.

609
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,499
Yeah.

610
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,500
Um...

611
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,917
I can't believe I'm doing this.

612
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,625
You're in good hands with me.

613
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:11,458
So, h-how does this usually work?

614
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,583
How do you want it to work?

615
00:35:14,584 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't know.

616
00:35:17,542 --> 00:35:19,292
I'm just really scared.

617
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:23,625
Why are you scared?

618
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,708
Because he's a bad person.

619
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:34,292
You don't know what I married into,
and it just keeps getting worse and worse.

620
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:38,917
I hear you.

621
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:47,167
Did you always know you wanted to be a...

622
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:52,583
Not exactly a childhood dream.

623
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:54,749
Do you ever think about it?

624
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,791
Like, if you did something else?

625
00:35:57,792 --> 00:36:00,958
Or... or if you chose a different path?

626
00:36:03,042 --> 00:36:05,917
I don't overthink things.
I'm not very sentimental.

627
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:09,208
Yeah. Well, we all have regrets.

628
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:14,583
Well, in my line of work,
I can't afford to think that way.

629
00:36:14,584 --> 00:36:16,416
I wish I could do that.

630
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:18,583
But I just feel like I'm in prison,

631
00:36:18,584 --> 00:36:21,083
and I'm gonna die in prison.

632
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:23,708
But I'm not gonna die in prison.

633
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:25,749
Because what if me coming here,

634
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,500
and meeting with you is the best decision
that I've ever made

635
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:31,583
because it's for, it's for me?

636
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:38,000
Oh.

637
00:36:38,917 --> 00:36:40,042
Sorry.

638
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,208
Shit.

639
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:46,874
Um, it's-it's him.

640
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:49,500
I-I have to go, but I brought the...

641
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:51,500
Can I throw something out there?

642
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:55,207
Listen, there's nothing in this for me.

643
00:36:55,208 --> 00:37:00,583
Technically I'm un-employing myself here,
but do your future self,

644
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:04,042
the one that deserves
a happy, fulfilling life,

645
00:37:04,043 --> 00:37:06,708
that can still have that, a big favor.

646
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:10,708
Take what's in there and get a new life.

647
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,895
Right now.

648
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:14,042
Don't go home.

649
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:17,708
And, if you need anything...

650
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:21,000
or if you change your mind...

651
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:23,833
you have my number.

652
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:43,374
Hello?

653
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,791
So, you're a fuckin' life coach now?

654
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:48,583
Is what I just saw and listened to
what I saw and listened to?

655
00:37:48,584 --> 00:37:49,708
<i>I'm not believing it.</i>

656
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:50,749
What?

657
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,458
"What?" Never mind our sting operation...

658
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:55,395
"Let me be your therapist?"

659
00:37:55,396 --> 00:37:57,332
<i>She's not a killer.</i>

660
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,791
She just needs to get it together.

661
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:02,042
I'm just out here serving
the overall public good.

662
00:38:03,376 --> 00:38:04,707
Public good?

663
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:09,375
What you just did was
one of the most unprofessional things

664
00:38:09,376 --> 00:38:11,292
<i>I've ever witnessed.</i>

665
00:38:11,293 --> 00:38:12,582
See? See?

666
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,750
This is what happens
when you hire an amateur.

667
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,791
Come on!

668
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:17,416
I steered clear of entrapment...

669
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:19,375
<i>No, you let the jury decide that.</i>

670
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:20,791
At least you got 'em in custody.

671
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,833
Okay. We can agree
to disagree on technique.

672
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:23,791
It's over.

673
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:26,082
And did you notice how cute she was?

674
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:28,417
I wonder if that had
anything to do with it?

675
00:38:28,418 --> 00:38:30,500
Well, we'll never know, will we?

676
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:32,582
Since this weirdo let her off

677
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:35,000
before she could start
incriminating herself.

678
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:39,437
It was, um, let's say, an unusual outcome,

679
00:38:39,438 --> 00:38:42,750
<i>and it'll be written up as such.</i>

680
00:38:42,751 --> 00:38:44,292
Okay, fine...

681
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,749
All right. Talk soon, Gary.

682
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,625
<i>- All right.</i>
- Bye, Gary.

683
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:50,708
<i>Bye.</i>

684
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,333
Jeez Louise, he's sweatin' Gary hard.

685
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,916
<i>I've seen this before.</i>

686
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:01,374
<i>Star goes down, back-up comes in</i>

687
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:04,124
<i>and just kicks ass forever more.</i>

688
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:06,625
I mean, I know
he dropped the ball on this one, but...

689
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:07,999
What's the name he used?

690
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,332
- Ron.
- Yo, Ron is fuckin' dope.

691
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,916
He's like a Caucasian Idris.

692
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:17,042
I would love to grab a beer with that guy,
and I'm not talking about Gary.

693
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:19,207
I would get black-out drunk with Ron.

694
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:21,833
I'd let him talk me into ripping lines
on the way to Vegas.

695
00:39:21,834 --> 00:39:24,374
I would rip my I.U.D. out for Ron.

696
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,874
<i>I wouldn't share a straw with Gary.</i>

697
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:29,375
<i>Gary is hung like a straw, but Ron?</i>

698
00:39:29,376 --> 00:39:31,292
Strictly nightstick.

699
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:36,250
I mean, it's kind of sounding
like you would fuck Ron, too.

700
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,292
I would take your sloppy seconds...

701
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,042
<i>if it were Ron.</i>

702
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:47,500
This whole prosecution
has been nothing more

703
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:51,542
than an entrapping, sting operation!

704
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:54,958
And this guy...

705
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,103
is the most dishonest, manipulative,

706
00:39:59,104 --> 00:40:02,208
fraudulent kind of person there is!

707
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,500
This Gary Johnson isn't a human-being.

708
00:40:06,501 --> 00:40:10,042
For a human being has humanity.

709
00:40:10,043 --> 00:40:11,416
Empathy!

710
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:16,875
A human being aids in moments of weakness.

711
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,375
Gary Johnson preys on the weak.

712
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:24,645
And as far as legal procedures go,

713
00:40:24,646 --> 00:40:27,832
it's like this undercover ghoul

714
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:32,249
is using an AR-15 to kill a mosquito.

715
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:36,666
<i>I am so used to this.</i>

716
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,541
<i>While I've put forth a ton
of irrefutable evidence,</i>

717
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:42,020
<i>all they've got is to somehow
make me the villain.</i>

718
00:40:42,021 --> 00:40:44,499
<i>And I know they're just doing their jobs,</i>

719
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,895
<i>but a personal attack
is still a personal attack</i>

720
00:40:47,896 --> 00:40:51,291
<i>and kind of sucks to have to listen to.</i>

721
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:54,999
We, the jury, find the defendant
guilty as charged.

722
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,375
<i>But in the "people are
forever mysteries" category,</i>

723
00:40:58,376 --> 00:41:00,332
<i>this would often happen:</i>

724
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,208
I mean, I've forgiven her.
She's forgiven me,

725
00:41:03,209 --> 00:41:05,500
and, hell, I've done much worse.

726
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:08,457
I think she deserves a second chance...

727
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:10,457
<i>Which was usually followed by this:</i>

728
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:13,417
In light of all the evidence
and testimony we've heard,

729
00:41:13,418 --> 00:41:15,479
we find the defendant not guilty.

730
00:41:17,844 --> 00:41:20,208
Congratulations, Tammy!

731
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,208
<i>Maybe their love wasn't perfect,</i>

732
00:41:26,209 --> 00:41:28,417
<i>but it was something.</i>

733
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:29,999
I hear ya.

734
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,375
I swear, our country's legal system...

735
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:33,958
Pull!

736
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:37,874
...is fuckin' fucked.

737
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,666
- Here you go.
- Ah, no.

738
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,458
You need the practice
a lot more than I do!

739
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:42,874
All right, then.

740
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,708
You can't blame someone
for taking the law

741
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:47,207
- in their own hands.
- Hmm.

742
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:49,167
You know, there's a thing
I really believe in.

743
00:41:49,168 --> 00:41:51,708
- What's that?
- That is personal justice

744
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,249
for when our pussified
justice system fails.

745
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,292
- When we do this, and we do it right...
- Right.

746
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:00,124
...personal justice, that's gonna be yours.

747
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:02,417
You didn't take all that
unfairness laying down.

748
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:04,250
Hell, no I didn't.

749
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Pull!

750
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,750
Now, that's the America
I miss right there.

751
00:42:12,751 --> 00:42:14,416
- Amen, amen.
- Uh-huh.

752
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:16,082
Look...

753
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:17,833
...there are three things
you need to kill a man.

754
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:18,832
Yes.

755
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:19,916
- The gun.
- Right.

756
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:21,042
- The bullets.
- Mm-hmm.

757
00:42:21,043 --> 00:42:22,291
And the balls.

758
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:24,542
And, boy, I am stockpiled
on three of those things.

759
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:28,167
Son of a bitch, Tanner.

760
00:42:29,793 --> 00:42:30,875
Pull!

761
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:36,041
That's what I'm talkin' about right there.

762
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:06,250
<i>I would, of course,
never cross this line. I'm a professional.</i>

763
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,667
<i>But technically, she didn't text me.</i>

764
00:43:08,668 --> 00:43:10,375
<i>She texted Ron.</i>

765
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:14,583
<i>But I don't think I'm a dog person.
In fact, I may be allergic to them.</i>

766
00:43:14,584 --> 00:43:16,082
<i>Physically and emotionally.</i>

767
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:17,624
<i>I find them to be too needy,</i>

768
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:20,208
<i>just pandering to whoever holds the meat.</i>

769
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:23,166
<i>But...</i>

770
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,291
<i>at the end of the day,
we're all spineless...</i>

771
00:43:26,292 --> 00:43:30,499
<i>we beg for more, embarrass ourselves
for the scraps of others...</i>

772
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,083
<i>Dogs just don't apologize for it.</i>

773
00:43:36,042 --> 00:43:37,417
Buddy.

774
00:43:42,917 --> 00:43:44,457
You made it!

775
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:47,166
Wow, I... I thought I loved puppies.

776
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:51,542
Well, I gargle barbecue sauce
like Listerine before these things.

777
00:43:51,543 --> 00:43:53,375
Keeps the bitches bitchin'.

778
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,478
I'm glad you came.

779
00:43:57,479 --> 00:43:58,958
I'm glad you invited me.

780
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:01,708
So, how are you?

781
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:05,374
I'm fine. I'm fine.

782
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:06,708
The real question is, how are you?

783
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:08,500
Oh, I'm, I'm great.

784
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:10,291
Yeah. I'm... I'm great.

785
00:44:10,292 --> 00:44:12,437
I-I got out of there almost immediately.

786
00:44:12,438 --> 00:44:14,582
I have my own place now in St. Roch.

787
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:18,417
I mean, it's a mess, but it's mine.
So, I love it.

788
00:44:18,418 --> 00:44:21,250
Um, I'm getting a divorce.

789
00:44:21,251 --> 00:44:22,583
- Wow.
- Yeah.

790
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:25,875
Sometimes you just gotta make a move.

791
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:28,750
I'm so happy for you.

792
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:32,707
You know, when I saw your text, I thought,

793
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:35,542
is she picking a dog charity
as the place to re-engage me?

794
00:44:35,543 --> 00:44:37,791
No! Oh, God, no. No.

795
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:40,958
That crazy moment has passed.

796
00:44:40,959 --> 00:44:44,125
New me, new life, he's...

797
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:46,874
And look at you now.

798
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:49,333
- You like the hair?
- Oh, I love the hair.

799
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,541
He hated it.

800
00:44:52,542 --> 00:44:54,958
Hated dogs, hated miniskirts.
So, you know what?

801
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:57,457
I'm just making up for lost time.

802
00:44:57,458 --> 00:45:01,750
Well, I'm... just so happy
this is how it's all going for you.

803
00:45:01,751 --> 00:45:03,082
Thank you.

804
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,457
No, but really thank you.

805
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:07,249
Like, I don't want to be weird
or anything,

806
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,042
but I kinda couldn't
have done it without you.

807
00:45:09,043 --> 00:45:10,292
There! I said it.

808
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,708
I don't get a lot of
thank yous in my line of work.

809
00:45:15,709 --> 00:45:17,833
Yeah, I guess not.

810
00:45:17,834 --> 00:45:19,958
Madison.

811
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:22,750
We have a situation in the husky cage.

812
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:24,021
Code brown.

813
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:25,291
- Hi.
- Hi.

814
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:27,458
Oh, um, Ron, Jill.

815
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:28,666
Jill, Ron.

816
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:30,417
Nice to meet you. You need any help?

817
00:45:30,418 --> 00:45:32,708
No, we're good. You okay?

818
00:45:32,709 --> 00:45:34,125
I'm good.

819
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:35,833
I got things to do!

820
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:36,833
Okay.

821
00:45:38,042 --> 00:45:39,124
Wow.

822
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:40,750
Oh, it's long, it's long!

823
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:42,416
Go, go, go!

824
00:45:46,042 --> 00:45:47,042
There it is!

825
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:49,625
Oh!

826
00:45:49,626 --> 00:45:51,500
Oh, no, no!

827
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:55,375
No.

828
00:45:55,376 --> 00:45:57,083
No. No, I don't buy it.

829
00:45:57,084 --> 00:45:58,166
What?

830
00:45:58,167 --> 00:45:59,292
You're not a hitman.

831
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:02,542
You can't be. You cuddled puppies.

832
00:46:02,543 --> 00:46:04,249
You played with kids.

833
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,917
You've opened every door for me tonight.

834
00:46:06,918 --> 00:46:09,750
And yet, you kill people for money?

835
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:14,124
Chivalry may be dead,
but I didn't kill it.

836
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:18,375
And I tried looking you up and nothing.
It's like you don't even exist.

837
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:22,292
I guess I'm just your fantasy.

838
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:25,417
Okay.

839
00:46:25,418 --> 00:46:27,042
We'll see about that.

840
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:30,750
How many?

841
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:33,792
Wait, I don't wanna... No, I do wanna know.

842
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,083
What? Does a gentleman not kill and tell?

843
00:46:40,084 --> 00:46:42,625
Okay. For the record, I love people.

844
00:46:42,626 --> 00:46:43,917
And yet, you kill them.

845
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:46,125
Not just randomly.

846
00:46:47,542 --> 00:46:49,292
It's always with a purpose.

847
00:46:49,293 --> 00:46:51,000
- To protect.
- Hmm.

848
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:52,999
And make no mistake,

849
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,375
there are some people who need killing.

850
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:57,292
Right?

851
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,417
Right.

852
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,541
So, what's the biggest
difference between...

853
00:47:06,542 --> 00:47:09,333
between the real you and your occupation?

854
00:47:09,334 --> 00:47:11,749
Mm.

855
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:17,625
I'd say the real me... is a people person.

856
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,333
I like to have a good time.

857
00:47:19,334 --> 00:47:20,458
But...

858
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:27,083
To be most effective in this job,
I have to be a bit of a lone wolf.

859
00:47:27,084 --> 00:47:30,042
I have to never draw
any attention to myself.

860
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,250
I don't want anyone to remember my face.
I don't want to over or under tip.

861
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:37,833
I don't want to be pulled into
memorable conversations.

862
00:47:40,917 --> 00:47:43,333
That's why I drive a Honda Civic.

863
00:47:43,334 --> 00:47:45,792
I want it to seem like I don't exist.

864
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:49,792
I don't know.
That's the professional side of me.

865
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:54,750
Tell me a little more about
the unprofessional side.

866
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:58,875
I'd say...

867
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:05,292
being here with you right now is...
pretty damn unprofessional, but, hey.

868
00:48:05,293 --> 00:48:07,792
Good. I don't want you too professional.

869
00:48:11,042 --> 00:48:12,458
How do you want me?

870
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:18,750
W-What?

871
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:21,208
Do I scare you?

872
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:22,833
No.

873
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,562
Do I scare you?

874
00:48:25,563 --> 00:48:26,875
Should I be scared?

875
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,750
That depends on what your intentions are.

876
00:48:34,542 --> 00:48:35,875
Okay.

877
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:40,333
You want to know all about me.
But what about you?

878
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,208
You know all you need to know.

879
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:44,458
Is that right?

880
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:53,687
<i>I was once told I think too much
to be a good lover.</i>

881
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:56,833
<i>She said exceptional sex
requires a lack of thought,</i>

882
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:59,250
<i>a certain amount of
animal abandon...</i>

883
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,625
<i>I liked Ron.</i>

884
00:49:04,417 --> 00:49:06,958
<i>He wasn't a thinker. He was a doer.</i>

885
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:17,416
<i>So, I don't know
if I was just better as Ron,</i>

886
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:20,687
<i>or if it was that electric charge
going through both of us...</i>

887
00:49:20,688 --> 00:49:23,957
<i>I mean, after all,
in her mind, she was having sex</i>

888
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:26,083
<i>with someone who had murdered
a bunch of people,</i>

889
00:49:26,084 --> 00:49:27,916
<i>and I was having sex with someone</i>

890
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:30,750
<i>who was clearly capable of
having a lover killed.</i>

891
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:36,500
<i>I'm not proud to say this,
but it upped my game.</i>

892
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:46,625
You know, I haven't been
with anyone else in so long...

893
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:49,875
Can I tell you something?

894
00:49:49,876 --> 00:49:51,000
What?

895
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:53,417
This is fun.

896
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:55,917
I agree.

897
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:00,083
I like this.

898
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:02,250
Us.

899
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:05,167
Yeah.

900
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:14,542
Look, on a full-disclosure,
cautionary note,

901
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,957
I've had a few girlfriends,
that early marriage,

902
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:23,520
but because of my line of work,
I generally have trouble

903
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:28,083
maintaining what most would consider
a normal relationship.

904
00:50:28,084 --> 00:50:30,042
Fuck normal.

905
00:50:30,043 --> 00:50:31,166
Amen.

906
00:50:31,167 --> 00:50:32,708
Do you wanna see me again?

907
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,750
Yeah.

908
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:38,542
But...

909
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,208
it's a little complicated. Isn't it?

910
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:43,792
It doesn't have to be.

911
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:52,187
This is a bad idea.

912
00:50:52,188 --> 00:50:53,958
I suppose it is.

913
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:05,500
For instance, we can never go to my place.

914
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:07,499
Good. I don't want to.

915
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,666
I can never give you any info
about my whereabouts, at any time.

916
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,833
If I'm tracked or traced,
you'd be pulled right in the middle of it.

917
00:51:13,834 --> 00:51:15,958
I will see you when I see you.

918
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,667
And we can only get so personal.

919
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:25,333
And the less you know about me,
the less I know about you...

920
00:51:25,334 --> 00:51:27,270
Okay, what's your next line?

921
00:51:27,271 --> 00:51:29,208
"Don't fall in love with me?"

922
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,750
I know what this is.

923
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:36,707
I don't want to know where you live,

924
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:39,750
or what you're doing at any given moment.

925
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:43,250
We're just going to meet here
whenever we want,

926
00:51:43,251 --> 00:51:45,374
and nothing outside of here matters.

927
00:51:49,042 --> 00:51:50,125
Well, okay then.

928
00:51:50,126 --> 00:51:51,666
Well, okay.

929
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:53,000
So we agree to the terms?

930
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:54,458
Where do I sign?

931
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:02,917
Anywhere else I need to sign?

932
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:07,792
Initial here.

933
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:11,542
Anywhere else I need to initial?

934
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:16,583
We gotta make sure
this document is air tight.

935
00:52:26,417 --> 00:52:30,249
The Freudian concepts
of the Id and the Superego are,

936
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:34,083
in Jung's point of view,
in constant struggle with each other.

937
00:52:35,292 --> 00:52:36,916
The Superego

938
00:52:36,917 --> 00:52:38,499
<i>is our conscience.</i>

939
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,582
<i>It rewards us for behaving properly,</i>

940
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:44,083
<i>adhering to societal norms,
moralistic standards.</i>

941
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:48,833
So, the Id...

942
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:51,166
<i>as humans, we have desires,</i>

943
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:53,208
<i>instincts that are primitive.</i>

944
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:58,250
<i>Urges that are solely based
in the pursuit of pleasure,</i>

945
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:01,042
ignoring the consequences.

946
00:53:01,043 --> 00:53:02,124
Now, the Ego

947
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:04,332
<i>is the middle-man.</i>

948
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:07,583
<i>The bridge between instinct and logic,</i>

949
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:09,416
<i>the law and the lawless.</i>

950
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:11,917
<i>Forever attempting to maximize pleasure</i>

951
00:53:11,918 --> 00:53:14,500
<i>while minimizing the cost.</i>

952
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:27,250
Welcome to Madison Airlines.

953
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,832
Where we flying?

954
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,708
Somewhere hot and tropical.

955
00:53:38,042 --> 00:53:39,917
Please follow me to the upper deck.

956
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:42,583
First class all the way.

957
00:53:42,584 --> 00:53:43,875
Shh.

958
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:48,292
Sir, please unbuckle your seatbelt.

959
00:53:48,293 --> 00:53:49,917
It's for your own safety.

960
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,458
We're expecting heavy turbulence...

961
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:03,082
So prepare to brace for impact.

962
00:54:31,292 --> 00:54:34,104
I know we agreed not to
talk about stuff like this,

963
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:36,917
and you don't have to answer
if you don't want to,

964
00:54:36,918 --> 00:54:42,375
but how do you do it and not get caught?

965
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:49,207
Well, you gotta be smart, thorough,

966
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:52,208
a few steps ahead of what you know
they're going to be looking for.

967
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:56,167
You know, the dirty secret is,
most murders go unsolved,

968
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,666
especially around here.

969
00:54:57,667 --> 00:55:02,582
So, my M.O., engage
in a more controlled area,

970
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:07,083
and then move the body
somewhere that says, "chaos."

971
00:55:07,084 --> 00:55:08,374
Isn't that messy?

972
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:11,291
Well, it can be if you're not smart.

973
00:55:11,292 --> 00:55:14,208
Quick, you're going to shoot me. Where?

974
00:55:16,417 --> 00:55:17,833
No! Lower.

975
00:55:17,834 --> 00:55:19,249
Lower.

976
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,458
Lo... okay.

977
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:25,208
The heart.

978
00:55:27,542 --> 00:55:31,041
I mean, certain areas
like the head or the neck,

979
00:55:31,042 --> 00:55:34,542
I mean, the blood
has nowhere to go but out.

980
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:36,624
Talk about a bloody mess.

981
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:39,917
And people, I mean, we're just
these big skin-bags of blood,

982
00:55:39,918 --> 00:55:42,542
and you have this big
beautiful thoracic cavity

983
00:55:42,543 --> 00:55:44,125
to hold it all in.

984
00:55:47,417 --> 00:55:49,417
Until you can move the body,

985
00:55:49,418 --> 00:55:50,792
set the scene,

986
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:54,042
tell the story you want them to find.

987
00:55:58,042 --> 00:56:00,542
<i>You know, I was always too shy
to go out for the high school play,</i>

988
00:56:00,543 --> 00:56:03,457
<i>but I had somehow found my stage,</i>

989
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:06,332
<i>and each arrest was like
a standing ovation.</i>

990
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:09,292
We're about to go
into the deep end of the pool here.

991
00:56:10,875 --> 00:56:12,375
This is serious.

992
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:16,541
If I take this envelope and leave,

993
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:21,542
this time tomorrow, her head
is in a Winn-Dixie bag.

994
00:56:21,543 --> 00:56:24,458
The rest of her is pig slop in Opelousas.

995
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:28,250
Now be absolutely clear with me.

996
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:31,333
Is that what you want?

997
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,250
Alright. I got this woman.
She's into this iPhone swiping.

998
00:56:35,251 --> 00:56:36,749
This boyfriend findin', right?

999
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,582
And she's slingin' the kitty
across the causeway

1000
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:42,020
with this manager from the Piccadilly,
and then wanna take everything, too.

1001
00:56:42,021 --> 00:56:45,458
Now, I don't know how things work
where you from, but from around here,

1002
00:56:45,459 --> 00:56:49,083
you don't take a man TV,
his dog, and his boat.

1003
00:56:49,084 --> 00:56:50,583
There's no way, T.

1004
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:54,083
Kill the slut.

1005
00:56:55,042 --> 00:56:56,542
With pleasure.

1006
00:57:03,542 --> 00:57:05,457
Your Honor,

1007
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:09,791
a psychopathic predator
will always be a threat to society.

1008
00:57:09,792 --> 00:57:14,125
On the other hand, someone
who once commits a crime of passion,

1009
00:57:14,126 --> 00:57:16,499
or sudden passion, as it is known legally,

1010
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:20,833
is no more likely to commit that crime
than any other member of society.

1011
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:23,999
In this case, I would characterize

1012
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,791
just the intent to entertain
solicitation of murder,

1013
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:31,958
although no one was ultimately harmed,
as kind of a "sudden passion"

1014
00:57:31,959 --> 00:57:34,583
as opposed to attempted
pre-meditated murder.

1015
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:35,895
Objection!

1016
00:57:35,896 --> 00:57:37,207
Overruled.

1017
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:39,166
A question would be welcome.

1018
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:43,124
Mr. Johnson, you testified previously

1019
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:46,207
that you felt this was
a pre-meditated act.

1020
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:49,082
By that, did you mean
you conjuring this whole thing

1021
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,958
and coercing them into a murder scheme
was premeditated?

1022
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:56,978
There was nothing sudden
or impulsive about our meeting.

1023
00:57:56,979 --> 00:58:01,124
The intent was clear.
The follow-through was detailed.

1024
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:05,333
Well, if you were not
attempting coercion, why the research?

1025
00:58:05,334 --> 00:58:09,374
Why the costumes? Why the disguises?

1026
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:13,291
Sure, my client has found himself
in compromising circumstances,

1027
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:17,208
but my question to you, Mr. Johnson,
what are your circumstances?

1028
00:58:17,209 --> 00:58:18,542
Objection, your honor!

1029
00:58:18,543 --> 00:58:19,957
Sustained.

1030
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:22,333
What are you hiding with these costumes?

1031
00:58:22,334 --> 00:58:23,707
Who are you trying to fool?

1032
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:24,791
<i>What would Ron do?</i>

1033
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,083
Objection, the defense
is badgering the witness.

1034
00:58:27,084 --> 00:58:30,041
My job is not to analyze
the events around my meeting.

1035
00:58:30,042 --> 00:58:32,999
My job is to meet the client
at those circumstances.

1036
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,458
Complete the picture
they've already drawn for themselves.

1037
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:40,000
I'm not in the business of second chances.

1038
00:58:45,292 --> 00:58:47,625
I got something we can play with.

1039
00:58:47,626 --> 00:58:49,083
I like the sound of that.

1040
00:58:49,084 --> 00:58:50,542
What do you got back there?

1041
00:58:50,543 --> 00:58:51,625
Pick a hand.

1042
00:58:52,958 --> 00:58:53,832
Left.

1043
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:55,458
- You lose.
- Whoa.

1044
00:58:55,459 --> 00:58:56,667
Shit.

1045
00:58:57,542 --> 00:58:58,625
What is that for?

1046
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:02,833
Well, what do you think?
I'm a woman living by myself.

1047
00:59:02,834 --> 00:59:04,249
I gotta protect myself.

1048
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,208
Plus, all that talk about murder
freaked me out.

1049
00:59:07,917 --> 00:59:08,832
Okay.

1050
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:11,917
Trust me, that is not gonna be
making you any safer.

1051
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,500
You have a gun.

1052
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:17,000
It's a little different.
I'm a professional.

1053
00:59:17,001 --> 00:59:18,417
Mm.

1054
00:59:18,917 --> 00:59:21,958
Well, are you going to show me
how to use it or what?

1055
00:59:21,959 --> 00:59:24,333
- Now?
- Mm-hmm.

1056
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:26,916
Didn't we have a contract?

1057
00:59:26,917 --> 00:59:29,208
Nothing outside of here matters?

1058
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:34,042
We have to leave
our love nest at some point.

1059
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:35,542
Don't we?

1060
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:37,375
Do we?

1061
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,167
Okay. I suck.

1062
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,520
Self-healing targets.

1063
00:59:50,521 --> 00:59:52,041
Why is this so hard?

1064
00:59:52,042 --> 00:59:53,166
Ah, it just takes practice.

1065
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:55,250
Why don't you show me, hot shot?

1066
00:59:58,125 --> 00:59:59,791
Well, this distance

1067
00:59:59,792 --> 01:00:02,792
is for weekenders, tourists...

1068
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:12,250
That's my usual distance.

1069
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:20,041
Okay, wait. Just hear me out.

1070
01:00:20,042 --> 01:00:23,375
So, if the moon controls the tides, right?

1071
01:00:23,376 --> 01:00:25,479
- Yeah.
- And we're mostly water,

1072
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,583
how could a full moon not affect you?

1073
01:00:27,584 --> 01:00:29,582
Think about it.

1074
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:31,833
Well, technically, that makes no sense.

1075
01:00:31,834 --> 01:00:34,082
- No, it makes sense.
- No.

1076
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:37,458
A phase of the moon
has nothing to do with gravity.

1077
01:00:37,459 --> 01:00:39,041
It has to do with shadows.

1078
01:00:39,042 --> 01:00:40,750
A phase is just
how much of the sun's light

1079
01:00:40,751 --> 01:00:42,416
we're blocking on the way to the moon.

1080
01:00:42,417 --> 01:00:45,792
You know, the gravitational relationship
between the moon and Earth,

1081
01:00:45,793 --> 01:00:47,582
these two planetary bodies, is fixed

1082
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:50,437
so the moon may look different
throughout the month,

1083
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:53,291
but nothing is actually
changing on Earth, you know?

1084
01:00:53,292 --> 01:00:57,917
Okay, I didn't know I was out
with Neil fuckin' DeGrasse Tyson.

1085
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:01,124
Gotta keep you guessin'.

1086
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:03,042
- Let's go dance, white boy.
- Yeah.

1087
01:01:38,292 --> 01:01:40,333
Let's go, get the fuck out of here.

1088
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:48,917
Ray. Come on, man.

1089
01:01:48,918 --> 01:01:50,458
Madison?

1090
01:01:50,459 --> 01:01:52,000
Fuck...

1091
01:01:53,792 --> 01:01:55,874
- I've been calling you.
- Ray, please.

1092
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:57,915
Guess your hands have been
too busy to pick up, huh?

1093
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:00,875
Who the fuck is this?

1094
01:02:02,042 --> 01:02:03,125
I'm her boyfriend.

1095
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:06,124
Oh, really? Well, I'm her husband.

1096
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:08,375
- Ray, can we just please keep it...
- What? Keep it what, Maddy?

1097
01:02:08,376 --> 01:02:10,166
No, you tell me. You tell me, Maddy.

1098
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:11,708
- You want me to keep it cordial?
- Nice to meet you.

1099
01:02:11,709 --> 01:02:13,000
Yeah, you, too, boyfriend!

1100
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:15,417
Madison, you're pathetic!

1101
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:17,832
- Hey, you know what? No.
- Ray. Ray!

1102
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:21,083
No, I'm not done, okay?
Just get the fuck off me.

1103
01:02:21,084 --> 01:02:23,000
I'm just fuckin' around, guys.

1104
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:24,291
Come on!

1105
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:27,542
Is it a crime now to have a little fun
with your new friend here?

1106
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,332
Ray, can you just leave us alone?

1107
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:31,312
Goddamn it, Madison.
Don't walk away from me.

1108
01:02:31,313 --> 01:02:33,292
- Ray.
- Don't you fucking walk away from me,

1109
01:02:33,293 --> 01:02:35,542
you ungrateful bitch! Come here!

1110
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,875
- Shit!
- Apologize, motherfucker.

1111
01:02:37,876 --> 01:02:40,208
Yeah. He said apologize, motherfucker.

1112
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:43,375
He's a professional. He'll do it.

1113
01:02:43,376 --> 01:02:44,750
Show him.

1114
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:49,208
Fuck.

1115
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:54,083
Come on.

1116
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:55,708
Professional what?

1117
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,167
Yeah. Professional asshole.

1118
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,999
Really moving up in the world,
aren't you, Madison, huh?

1119
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,728
- See you again, professional.
- Come on, Ray, get outta here.

1120
01:03:05,729 --> 01:03:08,301
You know what? Fuck y'all.
You fuckin' deserve each other.

1121
01:03:08,302 --> 01:03:10,875
- Ray, c'mon, dude! Get the fuck out of...
- Shut the fuck up!

1122
01:03:10,876 --> 01:03:12,250
Not fucking cool man!

1123
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:16,625
I can't get over how amazing that was!

1124
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:20,416
You... you were incredible.

1125
01:03:20,417 --> 01:03:23,750
That entitled fuck doesn't
back down for anybody.

1126
01:03:24,792 --> 01:03:26,791
Did you see his face?

1127
01:03:26,792 --> 01:03:29,667
- Yeah...
- He just walked.

1128
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:35,250
That was wild.

1129
01:03:37,917 --> 01:03:39,291
All right, cool guy.

1130
01:03:39,292 --> 01:03:44,708
Nobody, nobody has ever
stood up for me like that.

1131
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,208
Well.

1132
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:54,749
Here.

1133
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,000
Best date ever.

1134
01:03:57,958 --> 01:03:59,499
Oh.

1135
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,875
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm. Mm.

1136
01:04:02,876 --> 01:04:04,041
That's good.

1137
01:04:04,042 --> 01:04:05,750
Oh, that is so good.

1138
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:11,667
So, it seems like you and Ray
have different takes on your divorce.

1139
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:13,957
I'm clear.

1140
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:16,167
I mean, I can't help it
if he's being all crazy.

1141
01:04:16,168 --> 01:04:17,667
I mean, you saw how crazy he is.

1142
01:04:17,668 --> 01:04:18,792
Yeah.

1143
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:22,667
You are divorced, though, right?

1144
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,208
Do you see a ring on my finger?

1145
01:04:27,292 --> 01:04:29,125
Do you see a ring on my finger?

1146
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:30,791
No.

1147
01:04:30,792 --> 01:04:32,125
Exactly.

1148
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:37,124
I mean, it's just like,
what are the chances

1149
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:39,833
that the same club we're at
is the same club he's at?

1150
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,917
Okay, what's up with all these questions?

1151
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:45,000
Fine!

1152
01:04:46,458 --> 01:04:47,667
I fucked up.

1153
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:50,125
I broke our contract.

1154
01:04:53,917 --> 01:04:59,708
But I will happily, happily sign
a new one when we get home...

1155
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:11,249
All right. Well, you seem upset.

1156
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:16,042
I'm not upset
with me pulling a gun on some dickhead.

1157
01:05:16,043 --> 01:05:17,832
It's not a big deal.

1158
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:20,541
I'm just saying,
you don't see me bringing you

1159
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,667
to where all my friends and
former lovers are hanging out.

1160
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,500
We just gotta keep this clean.

1161
01:05:24,501 --> 01:05:27,062
It was a coincidence!

1162
01:05:27,063 --> 01:05:29,427
Whoa. What the fuck?

1163
01:05:29,428 --> 01:05:31,791
Looky who's here.

1164
01:05:31,792 --> 01:05:33,583
I thought that was you.

1165
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:38,291
What's up?

1166
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:40,332
Oh, I'm just grabbing some takeout.

1167
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:42,937
Saw you across the way. I mean, what, huh?

1168
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:45,542
What are the odds of this? This is crazy.

1169
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:48,583
Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?

1170
01:05:52,792 --> 01:05:54,667
- Jasper.
- Madison.

1171
01:05:54,668 --> 01:05:56,167
Madison.

1172
01:05:56,168 --> 01:05:57,667
Madison?

1173
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,208
Madison...

1174
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:04,292
Have we met before?
You just look so familiar.

1175
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:06,082
No.

1176
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:08,167
No, I don't think so.

1177
01:06:11,292 --> 01:06:13,917
Ugh. Whatever. Maybe it'll come to me...

1178
01:06:13,918 --> 01:06:15,833
Maybe it will.

1179
01:06:16,417 --> 01:06:19,417
Okay. Well, I'll let you guys
get back to your dessert.

1180
01:06:19,418 --> 01:06:20,917
Just wanted to say hi.

1181
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:23,167
Have a good night.

1182
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:24,917
Enjoy the weekend.

1183
01:06:26,042 --> 01:06:27,500
Good to see ya.

1184
01:06:27,501 --> 01:06:28,937
All right.

1185
01:06:28,938 --> 01:06:30,375
- Bye!
- Bye.

1186
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:33,791
Oh.

1187
01:06:33,792 --> 01:06:36,417
Now, that was a coincidence.

1188
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:40,042
Who's he?

1189
01:06:42,792 --> 01:06:45,917
Just some guy I used to work with.

1190
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:54,042
So, ex-husband, ex-coworker...

1191
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:56,833
are we even?

1192
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:58,749
No.

1193
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:00,042
Yes.

1194
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,792
I'll sign the contract again.

1195
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:19,375
What are we doing?
I got no notice. I got no research.

1196
01:07:19,376 --> 01:07:20,749
Feel like I'm going in naked.

1197
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:23,292
Well, this is when you actually
have to be good at your job.

1198
01:07:23,293 --> 01:07:25,875
Halloween's over.
No more costumes, man.

1199
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:28,457
All right. We did not get much on him.

1200
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:30,875
We didn't even have time
to get a Title III warrant,

1201
01:07:30,876 --> 01:07:32,291
so it's audio only.

1202
01:07:32,292 --> 01:07:33,707
His name is Mike.

1203
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:35,875
He's already in there waiting,
and he seems a little volatile.

1204
01:07:35,876 --> 01:07:37,999
Woo-hoo! This is gettin' scary.

1205
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,083
Wait, do we even know
what this guy looks like?

1206
01:07:40,084 --> 01:07:42,167
No, but he said
he'd be the guy sitting alone

1207
01:07:42,168 --> 01:07:43,707
reading "Catcher in the Rye."

1208
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:46,042
Which, historically speaking,
is never a good sign.

1209
01:07:46,043 --> 01:07:47,791
It's gonna be fine, Gary.

1210
01:07:47,792 --> 01:07:49,166
You could do this in your sleep.

1211
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:51,292
Just another pussy
too scared to do it himself.

1212
01:07:51,293 --> 01:07:52,583
You got this, G.

1213
01:07:54,042 --> 01:07:55,957
Okay.

1214
01:07:55,958 --> 01:07:57,250
Enjoy your breakfast.

1215
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:26,249
Mike?

1216
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:27,416
Yeah. Judd?

1217
01:08:27,417 --> 01:08:30,250
Eyes forward!
It's for your own protection.

1218
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:35,375
So, tell me, Mike, how can I help you?

1219
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:37,500
- So you're...?
- I am.

1220
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:41,958
And you...?

1221
01:08:41,959 --> 01:08:43,417
I do.

1222
01:08:45,292 --> 01:08:47,582
So, tell me what you're thinking.

1223
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:49,833
Unless you came here for the pancakes.

1224
01:08:51,292 --> 01:08:52,458
My wife.

1225
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:57,874
What'd you have in mind?

1226
01:08:57,875 --> 01:09:01,667
What do you think? Slut's killing me.

1227
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:05,292
I can't live just knowing she's out there...

1228
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:07,875
with someone else.

1229
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:13,167
So, now I'm here... with you.

1230
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:17,500
So why do you need me?

1231
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:20,045
Why aren't you taking care
of this shit yourself?

1232
01:09:20,625 --> 01:09:22,417
Oh, believe me, I want to,

1233
01:09:23,708 --> 01:09:27,125
but we're going through
a divorce right now.

1234
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:30,042
And I'd be the number one suspect.

1235
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:35,000
So, I need the perfect front,
you know, the perfect alibi.

1236
01:09:37,042 --> 01:09:39,292
So, you're not technically divorced yet?

1237
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,667
What's it to you?

1238
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:47,167
Oh, I forgot to mention, too. It's...

1239
01:09:47,168 --> 01:09:49,458
Well, it might be a twofer.

1240
01:09:49,459 --> 01:09:51,750
She's got this new boyfriend.

1241
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:54,250
He's a real douche.

1242
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:57,917
And?

1243
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:02,083
And, if he's there,
you can take him out, too.

1244
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:07,083
I've got no problem with that.

1245
01:10:07,084 --> 01:10:08,708
It's gonna cost you more.

1246
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:10,729
You good with it?

1247
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:12,750
Yeah, fuck em' both.

1248
01:10:13,875 --> 01:10:15,000
Done.

1249
01:10:15,792 --> 01:10:16,958
You bring the money?

1250
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:20,875
Yeah, it's right here.
Should be enough for both of them.

1251
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:28,000
I have a special request, though.

1252
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:32,167
I'm in the service business.

1253
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:40,583
When you do it, I want her to know why.

1254
01:10:41,958 --> 01:10:46,792
Right before you do it,
look her in the eye and say,

1255
01:10:46,793 --> 01:10:48,875
"This is from your loving husband."

1256
01:10:52,042 --> 01:10:54,792
I want that to be the last thing
she fuckin' hears.

1257
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:03,582
You know what?

1258
01:11:03,583 --> 01:11:05,917
Maybe I'll throw in
the boyfriend for free.

1259
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,374
What the fuck?

1260
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:10,749
What? It's very simple.

1261
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:13,417
You give me the money.
I'll take care of it.

1262
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:16,417
I'll take care of this shit myself.

1263
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:21,416
What the hell was that about?

1264
01:11:21,417 --> 01:11:24,375
I don't know. He just freaked out.

1265
01:11:24,376 --> 01:11:25,896
Happens...

1266
01:11:25,897 --> 01:11:27,417
Does it?

1267
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,667
<i>...right now. But leave a message.</i>

1268
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:37,265
All right. Madison,
if you get this, stay out of the house.

1269
01:11:37,266 --> 01:11:39,782
All right? I'm hearing some stuff
about Ray. Just call...

1270
01:11:42,667 --> 01:11:43,750
What the fuck was that?

1271
01:11:43,751 --> 01:11:45,207
- What?
- What?

1272
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:48,292
What do you mean what?
The guy just bolts out?

1273
01:11:48,293 --> 01:11:50,167
I don't know. He panicked.

1274
01:11:50,168 --> 01:11:52,041
Well, you can't win 'em all.

1275
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:55,458
No, you sure can't with that attitude.
If they're uneasy, you put 'em at ease.

1276
01:11:55,459 --> 01:11:58,292
From my perspective,
you're getting a little sloppy.

1277
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:02,083
Maybe so.

1278
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:08,250
Look, I wanted to talk with you
about the other night...

1279
01:12:09,083 --> 01:12:11,667
Oh? What about it?

1280
01:12:14,292 --> 01:12:15,249
Oh, her?

1281
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:18,458
Hey, I get it, man.
It all makes sense to me now.

1282
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:20,541
It's cool.

1283
01:12:20,542 --> 01:12:23,166
I've fucked my share of suspects.

1284
01:12:23,167 --> 01:12:25,999
It's no big deal. It's good for ya.

1285
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,832
I just ran into her. All right?

1286
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:31,042
She was just thanking me
for steering her in the right direction.

1287
01:12:31,043 --> 01:12:33,833
Uh huh, I bet she was.

1288
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:38,750
I just don't want things
to get misconstrued.

1289
01:12:38,751 --> 01:12:39,792
Gary...

1290
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:42,667
you can trust me.

1291
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:46,708
Wait, wait...

1292
01:12:47,792 --> 01:12:50,583
Just tell me this one more time.
He's trying to put out a hit on me?

1293
01:12:50,584 --> 01:12:53,082
Yes! He's trying to hire me to kill you!

1294
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:55,083
What do you not get
about that? We gotta go.

1295
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:57,958
- And he saw you in person?
- Yeah.

1296
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:01,458
- And he knows what you do?
- Yeah.

1297
01:13:03,458 --> 01:13:04,792
So, are you gonna kill me?

1298
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:08,208
What are you talking about?

1299
01:13:08,792 --> 01:13:10,667
Are you gonna kill me?

1300
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:13,125
No.

1301
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:16,750
Then I have nothing to worry about.

1302
01:13:21,667 --> 01:13:23,458
I think he might do it himself.

1303
01:13:23,459 --> 01:13:25,167
No, he won't.

1304
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:27,708
He won't. He won't.

1305
01:13:28,958 --> 01:13:33,417
Okay. So, I ask the modern-day jury,
what is your verdict?

1306
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:38,542
We've decided on life without parole.

1307
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:41,582
How very modern of you.

1308
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,582
How did you arrive at this conclusion?

1309
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:47,145
Well, even though we felt this person
is guilty of a heinous act,

1310
01:13:47,146 --> 01:13:50,708
we don't think a state-sanctioned killing
accomplishes anything,

1311
01:13:50,709 --> 01:13:53,292
and only causes more pain and suffering.

1312
01:13:53,293 --> 01:13:54,292
Okay.

1313
01:13:54,917 --> 01:13:56,999
It's a nice example of a legal system

1314
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,458
set up to respond
to the will of its citizens.

1315
01:14:00,042 --> 01:14:04,542
Now, let's jump back in time
to our Paleolithic friends,

1316
01:14:04,543 --> 01:14:08,042
25,000 years ago,
where things are very different.

1317
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:09,457
You have no jury.

1318
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:11,603
You have no official legal system.

1319
01:14:11,604 --> 01:14:13,749
You're just a nomadic community.

1320
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:16,624
So, what are you gonna do
about your problem,

1321
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:20,542
this existential threat
in the form of your unhinged leader

1322
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,916
who's invading other tribes?

1323
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:24,812
He's killing. He's raping. He's pillaging.

1324
01:14:24,813 --> 01:14:27,708
Seems like he's gonna get you all killed.

1325
01:14:27,709 --> 01:14:29,708
What are your options?

1326
01:14:29,709 --> 01:14:31,707
We're kinda mixed.

1327
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:33,457
Some of us think we should exile him...

1328
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:36,333
We don't have the means to exile him.
We gonna put him on a boat?

1329
01:14:36,334 --> 01:14:37,667
The majority of us...

1330
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,416
want to eliminate him.

1331
01:14:40,417 --> 01:14:43,375
Whatever we have to do
for our own survival.

1332
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:46,958
Whoo. Don't mess with Jerren.

1333
01:14:46,959 --> 01:14:48,625
So, how do you solve this problem?

1334
01:14:48,626 --> 01:14:50,000
Execution.

1335
01:14:50,792 --> 01:14:52,250
That's ruthless,

1336
01:14:53,292 --> 01:14:56,457
but historically,
potentially the right choice.

1337
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:59,687
There's been a lot of scholarship
on this very subject recently.

1338
01:14:59,688 --> 01:15:02,916
And the new thinking is
that these kind of targeted killings

1339
01:15:02,917 --> 01:15:06,625
actually play a larger part in our
social evolution than previously thought.

1340
01:15:06,626 --> 01:15:11,208
This impulse to weed out
these destabilizing forces

1341
01:15:11,209 --> 01:15:15,916
is likely a dark thread
in our historical DNA.

1342
01:15:15,917 --> 01:15:18,333
These killings were thought
to have served a twofold purpose.

1343
01:15:18,334 --> 01:15:21,417
They not only protected
social coherence and norms,

1344
01:15:21,418 --> 01:15:24,479
but also eliminated
a certain kind of abusive

1345
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,218
and uncooperative person
from the gene pool.

1346
01:15:27,219 --> 01:15:29,958
Excuse me. When did our professor get hot?

1347
01:15:29,959 --> 01:15:31,250
I know.

1348
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:34,583
And you'll get those comp stats
over to Headquarters this afternoon?

1349
01:15:34,584 --> 01:15:36,000
Mm-hmm.

1350
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:39,874
They know about the body?

1351
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:41,875
No. I haven't had a chance
to tell them yet.

1352
01:15:41,876 --> 01:15:43,291
What body?

1353
01:15:43,292 --> 01:15:44,374
You remember the lady came in,

1354
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:46,417
trying to have her husband
killed, that we let go?

1355
01:15:46,418 --> 01:15:48,082
No, that he let go.

1356
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:50,041
Madison Figueroa Masters.

1357
01:15:50,042 --> 01:15:51,999
Ah, the one you were Ron.

1358
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,125
Yeah, her husband was just found dead.

1359
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:58,624
I'm sorry. What happened? Where?

1360
01:15:58,625 --> 01:16:01,708
The body was found
in Cabbage Alley off Chef Menteur.

1361
01:16:01,709 --> 01:16:03,249
Possible drug deal gone bad.

1362
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:06,250
Single bullet to the aorta. A .38.

1363
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:15,458
Gary?

1364
01:16:18,292 --> 01:16:20,582
Yeah. When I was researching our guy,

1365
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:23,750
seemed like he had
a lot of drug problems, so...

1366
01:16:26,125 --> 01:16:27,541
Any suspects?

1367
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:29,833
Not really. Sounds like
she and the husband got into it

1368
01:16:29,834 --> 01:16:31,624
outside of a bar called Virgo's,

1369
01:16:31,625 --> 01:16:33,708
and then the guy she was with
pulled a gun on him.

1370
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:36,958
Did we ID that guy?

1371
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:38,542
Not yet.

1372
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:45,167
Maybe it's a new boyfriend or something?

1373
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:49,125
Should we go
try to find this guy, talk to him?

1374
01:16:49,126 --> 01:16:50,791
I'm liking that.

1375
01:16:50,792 --> 01:16:52,249
Let us know what you find out.

1376
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:56,083
I think Johnson and I
should tag-team this.

1377
01:16:56,084 --> 01:16:58,375
Is that all right if I bring him?

1378
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,082
Sure.

1379
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,708
Are you cool with it, Gary?

1380
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,708
Yeah.

1381
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,374
What are you doing?

1382
01:17:35,375 --> 01:17:37,292
Looking for the boyfriend.

1383
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,167
Oh, shit! I found him!

1384
01:17:45,168 --> 01:17:46,832
Fuck! I'm good.

1385
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:49,291
Come on! What are we doing here?

1386
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:52,583
Hey. Look, I'm not going to tell anybody.

1387
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:53,707
Tell 'em what?

1388
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:56,000
So, I ran into her again.
Doesn't mean I'm the boyfriend.

1389
01:17:56,001 --> 01:17:57,750
Doesn't mean I have
anything to do with anything.

1390
01:17:57,751 --> 01:17:59,082
Whoa, whoa.

1391
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:01,249
Whoa. So defensive.

1392
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:04,874
Look, nobody's accusing you of anything.

1393
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:08,500
I was just wondering if you knew this guy?

1394
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:10,875
If he looked familiar?

1395
01:18:13,042 --> 01:18:16,167
Yeah, that was the guy
that ran out of the restaurant.

1396
01:18:16,168 --> 01:18:18,854
What was his name? Mike?

1397
01:18:18,855 --> 01:18:21,542
Ray. He's Madison's husband.

1398
01:18:21,543 --> 01:18:22,667
Right?

1399
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:26,292
Right.

1400
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:30,542
You see, I went back and listened
to that conversation that you guys had,

1401
01:18:30,543 --> 01:18:36,082
and it just took on a whole different
layer of meaning for me.

1402
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:40,417
You really knew what button to push
with that whole boyfriend line, huh?

1403
01:18:40,418 --> 01:18:41,332
Huh?

1404
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:43,167
What are you getting at?

1405
01:18:45,708 --> 01:18:47,957
Nothing. It's just...

1406
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:50,542
Hey, look, we're friends, right, Gary?

1407
01:18:50,543 --> 01:18:52,332
Let you in on something.

1408
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:57,124
Over the years,
I've sort of learned to follow my nose

1409
01:18:57,125 --> 01:19:01,708
on these hunches that I have, and usually
something turns up pretty interesting.

1410
01:19:03,292 --> 01:19:04,542
Valuable.

1411
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:06,500
Let me know what you find.

1412
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:09,875
Maybe.

1413
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:12,958
All right. Well...

1414
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,958
I don't know. Nothing here.

1415
01:19:22,417 --> 01:19:23,833
You scared me.

1416
01:19:25,167 --> 01:19:26,292
Hi.

1417
01:19:29,292 --> 01:19:31,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

1418
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:33,624
Like what?

1419
01:19:33,625 --> 01:19:36,125
You're looking at me
like something's wrong.

1420
01:19:36,126 --> 01:19:38,000
Is something wrong?

1421
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:42,083
Anything out of the ordinary?

1422
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,541
Okay, what are you doing?

1423
01:19:44,542 --> 01:19:46,583
Look, Ron, it's too early for this shit.

1424
01:19:46,584 --> 01:19:48,208
Did you hear about Ray?

1425
01:19:50,792 --> 01:19:52,625
That he's dead?

1426
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:53,750
Yeah.

1427
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:56,417
How do you know about that?

1428
01:19:56,418 --> 01:19:57,875
I just know.

1429
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:03,542
Were you ever going to tell me?
You just didn't think it would come up?

1430
01:20:03,543 --> 01:20:05,250
Yeah, but who told you?

1431
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,957
This is sort of my area.

1432
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:11,332
You know, I listen to police scanners.

1433
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:13,625
I tend to know
who's being killed in this town.

1434
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:18,333
I'm wondering if you're okay
'cause you seem weirdly okay.

1435
01:20:18,334 --> 01:20:20,292
I was obviously going to tell you.

1436
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:25,875
It's just that I'm still
just processing it all.

1437
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:30,853
I don't really know what to do with it.

1438
01:20:30,854 --> 01:20:33,457
You know, it's a weird position to be in.

1439
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:36,375
Am I supposed to be playing
the role of a grieving widow?

1440
01:20:36,376 --> 01:20:39,625
Well, I don't know how to pretend.

1441
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:43,000
Was he a good guy? No.

1442
01:20:43,792 --> 01:20:47,083
Did I love him?
I mean, I loved him.

1443
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:51,000
Just... people grieve in different ways.

1444
01:20:53,208 --> 01:20:57,042
I just have to know.
Did you have anything to do with this?

1445
01:20:57,043 --> 01:21:00,458
Why the fuck would I have
anything to do with this?

1446
01:21:00,459 --> 01:21:02,374
What motive? You think...

1447
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:05,708
I'm the one who talked you out of
killing him in the first place, remember?

1448
01:21:05,709 --> 01:21:07,542
What, you think
I'm just out there on my own

1449
01:21:07,543 --> 01:21:09,042
killing people for no money?

1450
01:21:09,043 --> 01:21:10,542
Okay.

1451
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:13,708
I just had to ask.

1452
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:19,125
I'm sorry.

1453
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:24,292
It's okay. I'm...

1454
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:27,375
I understand.

1455
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:35,417
Come here.

1456
01:21:38,792 --> 01:21:40,542
I'm really happy you're here.

1457
01:21:40,543 --> 01:21:41,833
Me, too.

1458
01:21:44,375 --> 01:21:46,291
So, what happened?

1459
01:21:46,292 --> 01:21:48,083
Police call you to let you know?

1460
01:21:48,084 --> 01:21:50,124
Yeah.

1461
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:53,333
And what are they saying?
Any suspects? Arrests?

1462
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:58,667
They think there was a drug deal going on.
They just found him shot.

1463
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:03,708
I'm so scared.

1464
01:22:03,709 --> 01:22:05,707
I know.

1465
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:07,208
It's so weird,

1466
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:10,833
so out of the blue.

1467
01:22:14,542 --> 01:22:17,375
But you don't have to be scared.
Why would you be scared?

1468
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:22,083
Because I killed him.

1469
01:22:28,792 --> 01:22:30,375
You killed him?

1470
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:31,874
Yeah.

1471
01:22:34,167 --> 01:22:36,125
Why would you do that?

1472
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:39,708
You told me yourself.
He was gonna come and kill me!

1473
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:43,708
So, he was attacking you.
It was like self-defense.

1474
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:47,250
- Technically...
- Technically, what? What was he doing?

1475
01:22:47,251 --> 01:22:50,958
He was either passed out or asleep.

1476
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:53,417
And you killed him?

1477
01:22:53,418 --> 01:22:54,666
Yeah.

1478
01:22:54,667 --> 01:22:57,167
I made a story, and they're believing it.

1479
01:22:57,168 --> 01:22:59,166
Oh, my God...

1480
01:22:59,167 --> 01:23:02,917
Oh, my God!

1481
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:05,666
Why are you getting
so worked up about this?

1482
01:23:05,667 --> 01:23:07,708
- You do this shit all the time.
- I don't do this all the time.

1483
01:23:07,709 --> 01:23:10,333
I've never done this.
I've never killed anyone.

1484
01:23:10,334 --> 01:23:12,708
What are you talking about?

1485
01:23:12,709 --> 01:23:14,167
I'm a fake hitman.

1486
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:20,958
That's why I didn't put you away.
I didn't have you arrested.

1487
01:23:20,959 --> 01:23:24,583
Because I was working undercover.

1488
01:23:24,584 --> 01:23:26,125
You're a cop?

1489
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:27,833
No. I...

1490
01:23:31,083 --> 01:23:33,792
I teach at a college.
This hitman thing's just a part-time gig

1491
01:23:33,793 --> 01:23:35,541
that's gotten out of hand.

1492
01:23:35,542 --> 01:23:38,167
So, you've been lying to me
this whole time?

1493
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:43,417
I was stuck.

1494
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:48,375
I didn't want to lose you,
and you met Ron first.

1495
01:23:48,376 --> 01:23:50,167
And you liked Ron...

1496
01:23:50,917 --> 01:23:54,250
I liked Ron.
So, I didn't want to show you Gary.

1497
01:23:54,251 --> 01:23:55,958
Who the fuck is Gary?

1498
01:23:56,958 --> 01:23:57,958
I'm Gary.

1499
01:23:58,708 --> 01:24:00,374
I don't even know your name?

1500
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:02,042
My real name is Gary Johnson.

1501
01:24:03,792 --> 01:24:05,666
- Gary?
- I know!

1502
01:24:07,355 --> 01:24:09,041
- Oh.
- Sorry.

1503
01:24:09,042 --> 01:24:11,250
- They've called three times.
- Oh.

1504
01:24:12,042 --> 01:24:15,875
Something must be going on.
A situation probably...

1505
01:24:15,876 --> 01:24:17,457
Hey, how's it going, Claude?

1506
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:20,625
<i>Gary, where are you?
We need you back at the station now.</i>

1507
01:24:20,626 --> 01:24:22,791
- Now?
<i>- Yes, now.</i>

1508
01:24:22,792 --> 01:24:25,292
<i>We got a new development
on this Madison Masters.</i>

1509
01:24:27,917 --> 01:24:29,833
Okay. I'll be right there.

1510
01:24:30,792 --> 01:24:32,291
I'm sorry.

1511
01:24:32,292 --> 01:24:35,625
I gotta handle something really quickly,
and then I'm gonna be right back...

1512
01:24:35,626 --> 01:24:36,708
Don't.

1513
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:41,458
Just leave, whatever your name is.

1514
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:47,958
<i>I might have walked in as Ron,
but I left as Gary.</i>

1515
01:24:52,917 --> 01:24:55,042
Johnson's here! Phil, briefing room.

1516
01:24:57,875 --> 01:24:59,937
Wait 'til you hear this.

1517
01:24:59,938 --> 01:25:02,010
Hey! Lookin' good, Gary.

1518
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,458
Glad you could make it.

1519
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:15,833
This is looking more and more
like we messed this up.

1520
01:25:15,834 --> 01:25:19,083
Madison Figueroa
is now the number one suspect.

1521
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:21,958
- Really?
- Really.

1522
01:25:22,542 --> 01:25:23,542
Have a seat.

1523
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:27,417
Tell him what we just found out.

1524
01:25:27,418 --> 01:25:28,457
About six months ago,

1525
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:31,125
Ray Masters increased
his life insurance policy

1526
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:32,792
by one million dollars.

1527
01:25:33,833 --> 01:25:38,125
A policy in which, of course,
the wife was named the sole beneficiary.

1528
01:25:38,126 --> 01:25:39,082
Hm.

1529
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:41,791
Now, the policy pre-dates
the initial solicitation attempt,

1530
01:25:41,792 --> 01:25:44,875
but Homicide now believes there might be
some connective tissue here.

1531
01:25:44,876 --> 01:25:47,958
Maybe after your meeting,
she coerced someone else to do it,

1532
01:25:47,959 --> 01:25:49,291
or she did it herself.

1533
01:25:49,292 --> 01:25:50,708
That's what happens
when you let someone off the hook.

1534
01:25:50,709 --> 01:25:51,832
Not helpful.

1535
01:25:51,833 --> 01:25:53,708
And that was a long time ago.

1536
01:25:55,958 --> 01:26:00,000
Gary, did you ever talk to her again
after that time at the Please U?

1537
01:26:00,001 --> 01:26:03,458
Yeah. Actually, I did.

1538
01:26:03,459 --> 01:26:05,749
You did? When?

1539
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:07,874
Yeah, I ran into her at Ted's Frostop.

1540
01:26:07,875 --> 01:26:11,083
She just thanked me for helping her out,
giving her good advice.

1541
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:14,708
Actually, that was the night
I ran into you.

1542
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:16,167
You talked to her.

1543
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:19,500
You talked to her, too?

1544
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,500
I didn't realize that was her.

1545
01:26:24,501 --> 01:26:26,583
Yeah, that was Madison.

1546
01:26:27,167 --> 01:26:28,167
Huh.

1547
01:26:29,375 --> 01:26:30,416
Huh.

1548
01:26:30,417 --> 01:26:33,750
So, do you think she could be
involved in his murder?

1549
01:26:35,292 --> 01:26:38,500
I mean, there's always a chance,
but I would be very surprised.

1550
01:26:38,501 --> 01:26:42,458
She just seemed so happy.
She left her husband.

1551
01:26:42,459 --> 01:26:43,917
She got her own place.

1552
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:47,667
And just seemed like
she was doing really well.

1553
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:52,125
So, what are we doin' next here, guys?

1554
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:57,583
Well, we could pull her in
for questioning at any time.

1555
01:26:57,584 --> 01:26:59,958
She'll probably
just get a lawyer, clam up...

1556
01:26:59,959 --> 01:27:01,457
and if she's really behind this,

1557
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:04,374
she's probably got her lies
and alibis in order. You know.

1558
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:08,375
I'm thinking we got a one-time opportunity
to get the unvarnished story from her.

1559
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:12,375
This guy.

1560
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:14,750
- Me?
- Yeah.

1561
01:27:16,208 --> 01:27:20,916
Question, when you ran into her,

1562
01:27:20,917 --> 01:27:23,416
were you Gary, or were you the hitman?

1563
01:27:23,417 --> 01:27:25,750
Which one were you
going under on that one?

1564
01:27:25,751 --> 01:27:27,208
Ron.

1565
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:30,458
Okay, so you're still
Ron, the hitman, to her?

1566
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,875
Who else would I be?

1567
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:38,562
This is great.
I mean, look, she forever knows

1568
01:27:38,563 --> 01:27:41,833
that he knows
that she wanted to kill the guy,

1569
01:27:41,834 --> 01:27:45,270
and she must like him or trust him enough

1570
01:27:45,271 --> 01:27:48,707
to be sharing a sundae at Ted's Frostop.

1571
01:27:48,708 --> 01:27:52,458
I mean, let's face it, huh?
They got the goods on each other.

1572
01:27:52,459 --> 01:27:55,333
I mean, she would never
in a million years suspect

1573
01:27:55,334 --> 01:27:57,145
he's recording their conversation.

1574
01:27:57,146 --> 01:27:58,958
I think we got an opportunity here.

1575
01:28:00,917 --> 01:28:06,500
So, we manufacture a random encounter
where he gets her talking.

1576
01:28:06,501 --> 01:28:07,708
Not random.

1577
01:28:08,458 --> 01:28:11,207
Surprise encounter.

1578
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:13,708
I say we put a wire on Gary,

1579
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:16,167
and we go in now.

1580
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:22,458
Look, I'm thinking you can just
play this as a concerned check-in.

1581
01:28:22,459 --> 01:28:25,249
You read about the husband's death,

1582
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:28,792
and you're up front
about why you want to talk with her.

1583
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:33,874
I'm liking this.

1584
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:37,667
There's no tellin' what she'll say,
but once you get her talking,

1585
01:28:37,668 --> 01:28:39,708
you'll be able to tell
if she's lying to you.

1586
01:28:39,709 --> 01:28:40,832
Exactly.

1587
01:28:40,833 --> 01:28:42,750
You good with that, Gary?

1588
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:44,833
I think it's a good plan.

1589
01:28:45,667 --> 01:28:46,792
Very good.

1590
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,125
So, you send me the address.

1591
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:51,000
I'll meet you over there.

1592
01:28:51,667 --> 01:28:53,500
- Let's nail her.
- No, I'll ride with you.

1593
01:28:53,501 --> 01:28:55,208
I'll get you prepped.

1594
01:28:55,209 --> 01:28:56,917
See you guys in the van.

1595
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:05,250
You good?

1596
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:08,250
Yeah.

1597
01:29:09,167 --> 01:29:11,083
Okay.

1598
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:16,375
You're making me nervous.

1599
01:29:25,667 --> 01:29:27,499
Really? Does he need that?

1600
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:30,125
Yeah. I wanna be in his ear on this one.

1601
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:32,375
Go get her, Ron!

1602
01:29:38,625 --> 01:29:39,625
Hey.

1603
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:42,292
I got you.

1604
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:49,832
You guys there?

1605
01:29:49,833 --> 01:29:50,958
<i>Can you guys hear me?</i>

1606
01:29:50,959 --> 01:29:52,000
Loud and clear.

1607
01:29:52,708 --> 01:29:53,874
<i>Your ears working?</i>

1608
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:56,124
- Yep.
<i>- Great.</i>

1609
01:29:56,125 --> 01:29:59,167
Remember, audio only,
gotta get a good recording.

1610
01:29:59,168 --> 01:30:00,250
Got it.

1611
01:30:09,042 --> 01:30:10,167
We gotta talk.

1612
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:12,291
There's a bunch of shit coming down

1613
01:30:12,292 --> 01:30:15,083
that we gotta figure out quick,
or we are both fucked.

1614
01:30:15,084 --> 01:30:16,166
Wait, what?

1615
01:30:16,167 --> 01:30:18,354
Look, people know
I handle shit around here,

1616
01:30:18,355 --> 01:30:20,531
so because of that meeting
we had that one time,

1617
01:30:20,532 --> 01:30:22,707
I'm catching heat
for the death of your husband.

1618
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:25,375
- They're thinking one of us did it.
- Well, it wasn't me!

1619
01:30:25,376 --> 01:30:27,771
Look, I know you did it.
It's fuckin' obvious...

1620
01:30:27,772 --> 01:30:30,167
- ...and I don't blame you.
- I didn't kill him!

1621
01:30:30,168 --> 01:30:33,166
Wait, who's accusing me of this?

1622
01:30:33,167 --> 01:30:34,875
This is bullshit! And you,
out of all people, should know

1623
01:30:34,876 --> 01:30:35,957
that I wasn't capable of this!

1624
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:38,667
Okay, then who did?
What the hell happened?

1625
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,208
I just know what they've told me...

1626
01:30:41,209 --> 01:30:42,874
<i>Which is what?</i>

1627
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:44,792
<i>He got shot buying drugs.</i>

1628
01:30:44,793 --> 01:30:46,125
<i>Guy was an addict.</i>

1629
01:30:46,917 --> 01:30:49,375
Okay, so you say you didn't kill him.

1630
01:30:51,458 --> 01:30:53,125
When was the last time you saw him?

1631
01:30:53,126 --> 01:30:55,417
Not that long ago, at Virgo's.

1632
01:30:55,418 --> 01:30:56,416
The club?

1633
01:30:56,417 --> 01:30:59,833
Yes, the club.
I was walking out of Virgo's with this guy

1634
01:30:59,834 --> 01:31:02,833
that I met on the dance floor,
and boom, I run into Ray.

1635
01:31:02,834 --> 01:31:05,833
Ray loses his shit
when he sees me with this other guy,

1636
01:31:05,834 --> 01:31:07,875
starts running his mouth,
gets all threatening,

1637
01:31:07,876 --> 01:31:08,999
and fucking grabs me.

1638
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,874
And then this other guy,
trying to protect me,

1639
01:31:10,875 --> 01:31:13,875
he pulls out a gun out of nowhere
and sticks it in Ray's face.

1640
01:31:13,876 --> 01:31:15,958
Find out more about the guy with the gun.

1641
01:31:15,959 --> 01:31:17,166
<i>Ray freaks out.</i>

1642
01:31:17,167 --> 01:31:21,458
He leaves. I run away,
and that was the last time I saw him.

1643
01:31:21,459 --> 01:31:22,957
So, who's this guy?

1644
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:25,500
The one who pulled the gun.
What's his name?

1645
01:31:27,208 --> 01:31:28,666
I don't know.

1646
01:31:28,667 --> 01:31:31,250
- You don't know his name?
- I don't know his name.

1647
01:31:31,251 --> 01:31:33,332
We were having fun on the dance floor,

1648
01:31:33,333 --> 01:31:36,667
and I asked him
if he wanted to go somewhere else.

1649
01:31:36,668 --> 01:31:37,749
He said yes.

1650
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:40,207
We walk out,
all that stuff with Ray happened.

1651
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:43,583
So, you know what, if he said his name,
I didn't hear it.

1652
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:46,249
So, you don't know his name.

1653
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:49,833
You're just leaving the club
with some random stranger you just met?

1654
01:31:49,834 --> 01:31:51,416
Hey, fuck off!

1655
01:31:51,417 --> 01:31:55,250
I'm a grown woman.
I'm single, and he wasn't random.

1656
01:31:55,251 --> 01:31:57,208
He was a damn good dancer.

1657
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:00,207
Well, I'm happy for you.

1658
01:32:00,208 --> 01:32:02,499
'Cause your mystery man, he's a suspect.

1659
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,666
<i>I'm hearing they're looking for him.</i>

1660
01:32:04,667 --> 01:32:06,833
Nail her on the insurance policy.

1661
01:32:06,834 --> 01:32:09,124
Shit, well, so am I.

1662
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:13,042
Good men are rare these days.
He stood up for me. He protected me.

1663
01:32:13,043 --> 01:32:16,208
So, you know what?
If they find him, you let me know.

1664
01:32:17,083 --> 01:32:19,125
You know, that first time
we met at the Please U,

1665
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:22,457
your motive didn't seem financial,

1666
01:32:22,458 --> 01:32:25,250
like a lot of these other
pieces of shit I work for.

1667
01:32:25,251 --> 01:32:26,707
Yeah, because it wasn't.

1668
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:29,208
Then what is this
million-dollar insurance policy

1669
01:32:29,209 --> 01:32:30,957
everybody seems to know about?

1670
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:33,499
Don't act like
a million dollars is nothing.

1671
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:36,708
Don't you fucking lie to me.
You know what I'm capable of.

1672
01:32:40,792 --> 01:32:43,583
Ray's family has money.
They do shit like this.

1673
01:32:43,584 --> 01:32:45,374
They take out insurance.

1674
01:32:45,375 --> 01:32:47,624
Look, I don't even know
if I get any of that money.

1675
01:32:47,625 --> 01:32:50,875
For all I know, he changed
the beneficiary when we broke up.

1676
01:32:50,876 --> 01:32:53,875
Listen, I have no mind
for financial stuff.

1677
01:32:53,876 --> 01:32:55,499
Ray would talk about money

1678
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:59,583
and investments and shit like that,
and it would just go over my head.

1679
01:32:59,584 --> 01:33:02,125
Oh, you're giving me all the answers,

1680
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,375
but you are not giving me
the right answers.

1681
01:33:05,376 --> 01:33:07,000
I'm giving you the truth!

1682
01:33:07,001 --> 01:33:08,771
I still know you did it.

1683
01:33:08,772 --> 01:33:10,541
Fuck you! I didn't do it.

1684
01:33:10,542 --> 01:33:13,583
You know what? How dare you
come into my own house and accuse me.

1685
01:33:13,584 --> 01:33:15,916
You know what?
Get the fuck outta my house!

1686
01:33:15,917 --> 01:33:18,249
Hey, I'm on your side.
That is why I'm here.

1687
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:20,645
I'm trying to help you get away with this.

1688
01:33:20,646 --> 01:33:23,041
Not because I'm some
great guy or anything,

1689
01:33:23,042 --> 01:33:25,417
but as soon as the heat's off you,
it's off of me, too.

1690
01:33:25,418 --> 01:33:28,000
We can dig our way
out of this mess together.

1691
01:33:28,001 --> 01:33:29,166
There is no together!

1692
01:33:29,167 --> 01:33:31,416
I can push this whole thing
off on someone else,

1693
01:33:31,417 --> 01:33:33,604
but before I do that,
you have to tell me the truth

1694
01:33:33,605 --> 01:33:36,093
- so I can get this right.
- You know what? I'm done.

1695
01:33:36,094 --> 01:33:38,755
I'm done answering questions
from a fucking hitman.

1696
01:33:38,756 --> 01:33:41,417
You're not a cop!
Let them find out who really did it.

1697
01:33:41,418 --> 01:33:43,333
I've already told you
everything that I know!

1698
01:33:43,334 --> 01:33:45,750
I had nothing to do with this!

1699
01:33:45,751 --> 01:33:48,041
Ray was a druggie loser asshole.

1700
01:33:48,042 --> 01:33:50,333
Now get the fuck out of my house!

1701
01:33:50,334 --> 01:33:52,707
Hey! Last time.

1702
01:33:52,708 --> 01:33:54,999
I am offering you a way out.

1703
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,292
After I walk out of this door,
you're on your own. I could've helped.

1704
01:33:58,293 --> 01:33:59,792
Good. I don't need it.

1705
01:34:01,292 --> 01:34:03,833
And as far as we know,
they could be watching us right now,

1706
01:34:03,834 --> 01:34:05,875
so we should probably
never see each other again.

1707
01:34:05,876 --> 01:34:06,874
Great.

1708
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:08,958
You know, if you see me
publicly, don't say, "Hi."

1709
01:34:08,959 --> 01:34:10,499
Nothing personal.

1710
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,083
We just gotta keep this clean.

1711
01:34:12,084 --> 01:34:13,708
Fine by me.

1712
01:34:21,542 --> 01:34:22,542
Fuck.

1713
01:34:28,792 --> 01:34:30,208
What'd you think?

1714
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,125
What did you think?

1715
01:34:35,042 --> 01:34:37,374
You gave her
plenty of rope to hang herself.

1716
01:34:37,375 --> 01:34:42,167
Mm-hm. She's either the best liar that
we've ever encountered, or she's innocent.

1717
01:34:42,168 --> 01:34:43,916
Yeah.

1718
01:34:43,917 --> 01:34:46,958
- Damn it! I thought it was her.
- Yeah, me, too.

1719
01:34:47,792 --> 01:34:49,583
Yeah, she seemed pretty honest in there.

1720
01:34:53,792 --> 01:34:55,292
What about you, Jasper?

1721
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:01,333
Yeah. I tend to agree.
I don't think she did it.

1722
01:35:03,292 --> 01:35:05,500
Great work in there, Gary. Really.

1723
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,792
So this mystery guy,
the one who pulled the gun,

1724
01:35:12,793 --> 01:35:15,291
- should we try to hunt that guy down?
- No.

1725
01:35:15,292 --> 01:35:19,083
No, he just seems like some guy who
pulled a gun on an asshole in an alleyway.

1726
01:35:19,084 --> 01:35:20,458
Nothing much happened.

1727
01:35:21,542 --> 01:35:23,125
Yeah, we're done here.

1728
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:52,958
Oh, my God!

1729
01:35:53,542 --> 01:35:55,125
Yeah! There he is.

1730
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:58,208
The man himself.

1731
01:36:05,125 --> 01:36:08,375
I figured you'd be coming by here, man.

1732
01:36:09,042 --> 01:36:11,708
Come on, celebration beer?
I'm gonna get you a beer.

1733
01:36:11,709 --> 01:36:14,375
- You got it the first time. I got it.
- I'll get it.

1734
01:36:15,458 --> 01:36:16,750
She's awesome.

1735
01:36:17,625 --> 01:36:19,166
What's going on, Jasper?

1736
01:36:19,167 --> 01:36:24,208
I was literally just telling Madison here
what phenomenal actors you guys are.

1737
01:36:24,209 --> 01:36:27,124
So, I had to get backstage,

1738
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:30,374
poke my head inside the green room.

1739
01:36:30,375 --> 01:36:33,625
I mean, your performance was flawless,

1740
01:36:33,626 --> 01:36:35,042
but you...

1741
01:36:35,958 --> 01:36:37,374
you, my friend,

1742
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:39,583
knocked my fucking socks off.

1743
01:36:40,917 --> 01:36:43,125
Maybe I never gave you
enough credit, Gary.

1744
01:36:43,126 --> 01:36:45,271
Or... Ron. Sorry.

1745
01:36:45,272 --> 01:36:47,406
Gary... Ron...

1746
01:36:49,542 --> 01:36:51,833
I get them mixed up sometimes. Do you?

1747
01:36:51,834 --> 01:36:53,083
Sometimes.

1748
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:57,167
- Yeah.
- What the fuck is going on?

1749
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:03,624
Well, I was literally just
telling the lovely Madison

1750
01:37:03,625 --> 01:37:07,167
that I was gonna be fine
with whatever way it went this afternoon.

1751
01:37:07,168 --> 01:37:10,271
That if it just blew up in your face,

1752
01:37:10,272 --> 01:37:13,375
well, at least I'd get my job back.

1753
01:37:13,376 --> 01:37:15,999
But, if you got away with it,

1754
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,333
which, hey, congratulations,
it seems like you did,

1755
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:25,292
I would just have to settle
for a fuck-ton of money.

1756
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:30,833
Oh, this is where you would go,
"What money, Jasper?"

1757
01:37:30,834 --> 01:37:32,479
Or, "Money from where?"

1758
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,125
And then I would say,

1759
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:38,750
"the dead husband's insurance policy."

1760
01:37:40,417 --> 01:37:42,874
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1761
01:37:42,875 --> 01:37:45,667
This will be our little
understanding, okay?

1762
01:37:45,668 --> 01:37:47,542
The one that keeps me silent

1763
01:37:48,458 --> 01:37:51,250
and you guys out of prison.

1764
01:37:51,958 --> 01:37:54,207
- You got nothing, Jasper.
- Well, I...

1765
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:56,332
Nah. It's 'cause there isn't
anything. That we're dating?

1766
01:37:56,333 --> 01:37:58,333
- You think anybody gives a shit?
- Oh, shit! I didn't know that.

1767
01:37:58,334 --> 01:37:59,937
Hey! You've already
played your hand here.

1768
01:37:59,938 --> 01:38:01,542
- Congratulations.
- Fuck you! Get lost!

1769
01:38:01,543 --> 01:38:02,792
Hey! Stop.

1770
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:06,082
Stay.

1771
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:08,542
Babe, sit down.
We're gonna hear him out.

1772
01:38:08,543 --> 01:38:10,958
Yeah, babe, you're being a dick.

1773
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:20,416
I'm just trying to help you guys out.

1774
01:38:20,417 --> 01:38:22,708
- Help us out?
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Gary!

1775
01:38:22,709 --> 01:38:25,875
Enough. Okay? Enough!

1776
01:38:27,042 --> 01:38:29,124
Okay. Cut the bullshit.

1777
01:38:29,125 --> 01:38:32,020
Here, I'll go first, all right?

1778
01:38:32,021 --> 01:38:34,551
I've been following both of you.

1779
01:38:34,552 --> 01:38:37,083
And here, I'll be even more honest.

1780
01:38:37,084 --> 01:38:38,916
I wanted my job back.

1781
01:38:38,917 --> 01:38:44,500
Nothing against you personally,
okay, but holy shit!

1782
01:38:46,583 --> 01:38:51,625
I have enough evidence
to put you away for life.

1783
01:38:51,626 --> 01:38:52,875
And you...

1784
01:38:53,583 --> 01:38:55,833
an accomplice to murder?

1785
01:38:56,417 --> 01:38:59,833
Whoa, doggy.

1786
01:39:01,167 --> 01:39:03,541
You're gonna be there for a while.

1787
01:39:03,542 --> 01:39:08,583
And the only reason
that I'm 100 percent sure

1788
01:39:08,584 --> 01:39:13,625
that you did it, is because
I am 100 percent sure

1789
01:39:13,626 --> 01:39:16,625
that your Mr. Tough Guy here...

1790
01:39:18,208 --> 01:39:20,417
couldn't fucking kill a thing.

1791
01:39:30,583 --> 01:39:32,875
The house is hot.

1792
01:39:37,875 --> 01:39:39,417
And ironically,

1793
01:39:41,167 --> 01:39:44,375
life insurance might have
actually saved you guys here.

1794
01:39:44,376 --> 01:39:51,042
I mean, that money
got me thinking, that this...

1795
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,292
...dark...

1796
01:39:58,167 --> 01:40:02,042
fucking adventure, okay,
that we've all been on,

1797
01:40:02,043 --> 01:40:05,667
can actually have a happy ending.

1798
01:40:06,708 --> 01:40:09,958
Okay. So, the day
that you hand over the cash...

1799
01:40:11,708 --> 01:40:14,417
is the...

1800
01:40:15,958 --> 01:40:16,958
Fuck!

1801
01:40:20,667 --> 01:40:21,917
Fuck!

1802
01:40:43,125 --> 01:40:45,499
I'm fucked.

1803
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,208
What just happened?

1804
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:52,625
I put drugs in his beer.
I hope I didn't overdo it.

1805
01:40:55,625 --> 01:40:58,917
But if he wakes up, I'm going to jail...

1806
01:41:02,875 --> 01:41:04,500
I drugged a cop.

1807
01:41:06,667 --> 01:41:08,375
I am so fucked.

1808
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,458
What are you doing?

1809
01:41:48,292 --> 01:41:49,667
What's that for?

1810
01:41:51,333 --> 01:41:52,542
Commitment.

1811
01:41:59,333 --> 01:42:01,458
Can't get away with killing a cop.

1812
01:42:06,625 --> 01:42:09,708
Not usually, but for Jasper these days,

1813
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:12,833
I'm thinking we can.

1814
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:17,917
I mean, the police
are probably thinking about him

1815
01:42:17,918 --> 01:42:19,874
the way we are right now,

1816
01:42:19,875 --> 01:42:24,375
they'd just be better off
if he wasn't around anymore.

1817
01:42:32,042 --> 01:42:33,250
Oh, God.

1818
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:40,208
So, what's our story?

1819
01:42:42,042 --> 01:42:44,958
He gets found in his car
in a remote area.

1820
01:42:44,959 --> 01:42:47,875
Drugs in his system, bag over his head,

1821
01:42:47,876 --> 01:42:50,333
no contusions or sign of struggle,

1822
01:42:50,334 --> 01:42:51,833
clearly a suicide.

1823
01:42:54,125 --> 01:42:57,042
I mean, his wife left him years ago, so...

1824
01:42:58,542 --> 01:43:00,583
no one to question the story.

1825
01:43:01,667 --> 01:43:07,417
He's racist, misogynistic, abusive.

1826
01:43:08,667 --> 01:43:11,292
A dirty, dirty cop.

1827
01:43:14,833 --> 01:43:16,167
Fuck him.

1828
01:43:22,167 --> 01:43:23,812
Are we really doing this?

1829
01:43:23,813 --> 01:43:25,458
We don't have a choice.

1830
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:31,166
Look, I know you're taking
a big leap with me,

1831
01:43:31,167 --> 01:43:35,708
and there are some factual loose threads
we'll be dealing with, but...

1832
01:43:37,625 --> 01:43:39,000
I think I'm in love with you.

1833
01:43:43,667 --> 01:43:45,208
Well, it's always a leap.

1834
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:51,042
And for the record,
I think I'm in love with you, too.

1835
01:43:55,375 --> 01:43:56,708
For better or worse?

1836
01:43:59,125 --> 01:44:03,208
We can agree
this is kind of the worst, right?

1837
01:44:07,958 --> 01:44:09,083
Right.

1838
01:44:11,875 --> 01:44:14,333
So, we're in this 'til the end?

1839
01:44:14,334 --> 01:44:16,167
'Til death do us part?

1840
01:44:17,042 --> 01:44:20,083
Yes, because I don't believe in divorce.

1841
01:44:21,125 --> 01:44:23,707
I'm kidding.

1842
01:44:23,708 --> 01:44:26,833
So, do we agree on the terms?

1843
01:44:26,834 --> 01:44:29,457
I do.

1844
01:44:29,458 --> 01:44:31,083
Where do I sign?

1845
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:36,500
- Anywhere else I need to sign?
- Initial here.

1846
01:44:37,875 --> 01:44:42,041
We gotta make sure
this document is airtight.

1847
01:44:42,042 --> 01:44:44,875
I think there's a little place
down here I need to initial.

1848
01:45:02,125 --> 01:45:05,000
I know I've thrown
a lot at you this semester,

1849
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,582
but that's the point, isn't it?

1850
01:45:08,583 --> 01:45:13,249
To be inundated, overwhelmed
by perspectives and possibilities,

1851
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:17,458
because that is what life is offering you
if you choose to look at it that way.

1852
01:45:18,625 --> 01:45:20,124
And I didn't always.

1853
01:45:20,125 --> 01:45:25,874
I used to believe that reality
was objective, immutable.

1854
01:45:25,875 --> 01:45:31,417
And we're all just sort of stuck
in a Plato-Descartes-Kant sort of way.

1855
01:45:32,583 --> 01:45:34,499
But over the years, I've come to believe

1856
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,999
that the truth is created
through the integration

1857
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,542
of different points of view,
and there are no absolutes,

1858
01:45:40,543 --> 01:45:43,041
whether moral or epistemological.

1859
01:45:43,042 --> 01:45:46,333
Now, I find this to be a much more
empowering way to go through life,

1860
01:45:46,334 --> 01:45:50,167
this notion that
if the universe is not fixed,

1861
01:45:51,083 --> 01:45:52,707
then neither are you,

1862
01:45:52,708 --> 01:45:56,542
and you really can become a different
and hopefully, better person.

1863
01:45:57,458 --> 01:46:02,083
Now, the one thing I know for certain,
is your reality will change over time

1864
01:46:02,084 --> 01:46:04,541
in ways you cannot even imagine,

1865
01:46:04,542 --> 01:46:09,167
and I urge you to be open
for this transformation.

1866
01:46:09,168 --> 01:46:11,207
So, as we close out this semester,

1867
01:46:11,208 --> 01:46:14,417
if I have one piece of advice
for you moving forward

1868
01:46:14,418 --> 01:46:18,958
in this complicated world, it is this:

1869
01:46:20,417 --> 01:46:25,333
seize the identity you want for yourself.

1870
01:46:27,417 --> 01:46:30,083
And whoever you wanna be after this class,

1871
01:46:30,084 --> 01:46:32,916
be them with passion and abandon.

1872
01:46:32,917 --> 01:46:35,749
Whoo!

1873
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:38,333
Best of luck to you all
on your final exam.

1874
01:46:39,375 --> 01:46:41,000
You may begin.

1875
01:46:43,667 --> 01:46:46,374
All right. You see all those
white birds out there?

1876
01:46:46,375 --> 01:46:50,833
Notice the long orange bill, right?
That's the white ibis.

1877
01:46:51,833 --> 01:46:55,124
Look at those eyes. They're crazy.

1878
01:46:55,125 --> 01:46:57,166
All right, so,
I know we have the croissants,

1879
01:46:57,167 --> 01:47:00,208
and I know we have the cupcakes.
Are you bringing the apple pie?

1880
01:47:00,209 --> 01:47:02,333
Yeah, I'm bringing
Gary's famous apple pie.

1881
01:47:02,334 --> 01:47:04,874
That's wonderful. Okay. I have that.

1882
01:47:04,875 --> 01:47:08,333
Oh. And don't worry
about the costumes, I got it.

1883
01:47:09,333 --> 01:47:11,728
Thank God. You're the best,
Madison. Thank you.

1884
01:47:11,729 --> 01:47:14,125
We were hoping someone
would step in and help.

1885
01:47:14,126 --> 01:47:16,124
You know, Gabby just bailed for Aspen.

1886
01:47:16,125 --> 01:47:18,250
I could've literally
strangled her to death.

1887
01:47:20,397 --> 01:47:22,541
Yeah. I know.

1888
01:47:22,542 --> 01:47:24,167
Anyway, I'll see you next meeting.

1889
01:47:25,625 --> 01:47:28,917
<i>As love can do, somewhere
along the way, it changed me.</i>

1890
01:47:29,625 --> 01:47:32,875
<i>I eventually found the proper
cocktail of Gary and Ron.</i>

1891
01:47:32,876 --> 01:47:35,457
<i>After all, life is short.</i>

1892
01:47:35,458 --> 01:47:37,500
<i>You gotta live on your own terms.</i>

1893
01:47:39,708 --> 01:47:42,374
Mommy, where did you meet Daddy?

1894
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:59,667
Well, Daddy was
the nicest guy I'd ever met.

1895
01:47:59,668 --> 01:48:02,500
Even though he was being all tough,

1896
01:48:02,501 --> 01:48:04,624
I could tell it was an act.

1897
01:48:04,625 --> 01:48:08,582
And your mother, well, what can I say?

1898
01:48:08,583 --> 01:48:11,083
It was love at first sight.

1899
01:48:11,084 --> 01:48:13,417
She ended up making a new man out of me.

1900
01:48:16,833 --> 01:48:20,500
But to answer your question,
we met at a magical little place

1901
01:48:20,501 --> 01:48:22,458
called the Please U Cafe.

1902
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:27,833
You enjoying your pie?

1903
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:29,917
All pie is good pie.

1904
01:48:30,667 --> 01:48:32,375
It sure is.
