00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:04,600
grew up with.. I was the rebel..the hot head..the crazy one.

12
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,800
The one who would drink, the one who would smoke.

13
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,700
Rebel without a cause

14
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,220
The one who always wanted to do all the crazy stuff....the drop out..hahah

15

There you go. Thank you

Hi. Hi. I'm Eric from upstairs, number eighteen. Hi Eric, I'm Casey. Um.. what do you know about a cat?

25
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,940
The... the cat that's around the building? Yeah, that cat.

26
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,120
Well... what do you mean what do I know about it? Stop feeding it.

27
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:32,520
Okay, is there a problem with the cat? Yeah, there's a big problem... Every morning I wake up...there is shit on my mat.. every fucking morning.

28
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,380
ok

29
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,150
Ok? That's it?

30
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:42,150
I'm sorry, you know it's not my cat.... I feed it sometimes though. Well stop fucking feeding it if it's not yours.

31
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,970
It stops today.

32
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,699
If you feed it again... I'll fucking kill it

33
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,000
Hey

34
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000

Thank you

37
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,100
I gotta ask you a question?

38
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,120
Ok

39
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:43,800
You're in your kitchen. You're on the phone...every time I'm in the courtyard...that's all I see..what's up with that?

40
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,080
Well...um..

41
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,140
Yes, I am.... I work from home actually so I'm an operator for an insurance company

42
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,700
Cool

43
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,250
Um that's not really cool. Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty lonely

44
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,120
and isolating

45
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:10,950
I don't really talk to like any actual live people. It's just people calling in

46
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:19,440
All day calling with the same question. You never see a live person? No not really....

47
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,240
Except for you! Yeah, sorry haha

48
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,979
All my life right, okay, born and raised. Love it

49
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,359
That's cool. I'm actually I'm thinking of going back home.

50
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,270
It's not really working out here.

51
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,990
Back to mom and Dad?

52
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:54,919
No, they're not alive anymore, so I'm gonna go try and save up and move back with my cousin.

53
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,330
I see.

54
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,330
All right, I'm looking forward to moving home.

55
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,490
Alright, well. I'm hitting it, I'm out. Ok.

56
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
Have a good night

57
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,850

58
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,579
Bye

59
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,559

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:37,189
Hi, I'm it number three at five two two Detroit..

61
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:42,590
and I need to see if it's possible if I could please pay half of my rent tomorrow

62
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,159
And then I would for sure have the rest by the end of the week?

63
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,319
Oh my God, I was thinking of you. Oh my God. I was thinking of you.

64
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:06,059
There's this game. It is amazing. It's called hunting. I'm not really into video games.

65
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,940
It's not a video game

66
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,600
if you got a smartphone or

67
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:20,149
a computer... it's an app and this app puts markers on one of those like GPS maps, right?

68
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,749
ok so these maps..

69
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:31,369
Have these markers and these markers have these treasures and these treasures are left by people

70
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,370
oh like treasure hunting?

71
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:39,350
Pretty much adult treasure hunting treasure hunting for us big kids okay, and I thought of you...

72
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,980
What is it called? Hunting?

73
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,800
HUNTING

74
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,920
You have to download the app? Is it expensive?

75
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,420
It's free.

76
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,300
Hello Hunter! It's Gator 23105

77
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:22,379
If you're in the alley.. you're on the right track! Keep looking by the fence..oh..

78
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,179
..by the way, I lost my pen cap. Hope you can find it...

79
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:35,248
...and if you can't find it, there's something wrong with you. Happy Hunting!

80
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,920
All better now? I hope so.

81
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,720
It'll be fine..I mean...come on.

82
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,360
I swear I saw someone..it's so weird.

83
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,140
Maybe was just a shadow. Maybe it was just dark I have a lot of shit in there, too

84
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:04,110
Yeah, that's trippy. You got something going on...there's a lot more here to Casey, isn't there?

85
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,829
I just need to clean...a lot of clutter.

86
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,120
Well it's like my studio, so I have everything in there and then I just start stuff

87
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,120
And then don't finish it and move on to the next thing and before you know it..it looks like that.

88
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,990
All right

89
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,990
What kind of art you doing?

90
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,560
Just painting right now painting whatever sometimes sketching

91
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,520
I mean what you doing dogs, or you know skeletons, and you know.. what?

92
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,680
Well birds..I have the birds right now but..

93
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:49,860
Just whatever like I want to do a juke box. I think it's more about the colors.

94
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,800
Jukebox. Yeah, I like that

95
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,920
Dig it I dig it

96
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,000
You okay? Yeah, I just feel really stupid. Sorry

97
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,840

Hello Hunter! This should be a very easy hunt. I have placed it for my art project

109
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:37,569
please be a part of it and take your photograph with the camera found inside

110
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,710
The hunt lies in a shallow grave at the base of the tree in front of you

111
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:45,969
If you would like a copy of the finished project, please leave your address

112
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,720
Happy hunting

113
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:36,349
Hey everybody

114
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:43,639
Thanks for checking on my blog again. It's Casey and I made it out of the city into the woods today and

115
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,210
Looks like there's a lot of hunts in these woods, so

116
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,260
Let's go find them

117
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:12,679
This says I'm five feet away from it. I see trash and a shoe and

118
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:21,169
And I think a bag of shit um but if you want you're more than welcome to come and look with me

119
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,680
Let's go

120
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:36,210
and

121
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,650
that's

122
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,630
That's the bag

123
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,710
looks like a bag of shit, and I don't want to open it up, so

124
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,070
They just want to eat

125
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,490
Hey guys its casey here. Thanks for coming out with me today

126
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,929
I didn't find anything that it's been really pretty and a lot of fun

127
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:41,999
so thanks for coming out with me and if you want check it out check out my blog again tonight

128
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,070
because I'm going to go out again and

129
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:52,170
Go see if I can find something this time, so hopefully ..hopefully you'll come along. Have a good day. See you tonight

130
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:47,760
Hi this operator 899319 checking to see if there any available shifts to pick up

131
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:37,180
Hello Hunters, Jessica 83 here and welcome to my first Hunt!

132
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,780
If you're at my hunt, then you're a brave soul. This one comes all the way from Montana

133
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,560
And is especially amazing because I placed it on my trip to LA

134
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,429
We walked through here on our way to a concert at the bowl

135
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:52,500
and I thought this was the perfect place for a hunt so here we are

136
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,220
You'll have to do some looking

137
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,899
but it's worth the effort. If you can get past the piss smell you'll be fine. The tunnel

138
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,389
look dangerous, but it's not people walk through here all the time

139
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,330
Anyway, I wish you the best of luck and as always

140
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,970
Happy hunting

141
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,369
G'Day hunters Ozzy Jack here

142
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:18,549
I'm here in Los Angeles from down under visiting my daughter her and her friends don't know about this hunting business

143
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:23,380
So they think I've lost my mind wandering around the dirty bits of Hollywood looking for these

144
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,280
This one is in the nastiest smelling tunnel. I've ever been in. It's the truth.

145
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:36,220
Just awful quite interesting though, and it's not too difficult to find. My daughters stayed out there on the road wouldn't come in

146
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:41,680
Anyway, I've left a treat from Australia in there for you, best of luck and happy hunting

147
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:24,700
Hi Guys Casey here

148
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,140
so tonight

149
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:33,700
The hunt I went on it was I should have just trusted my instinct probably if you go on it's pretty cool. It's um

150
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,280
if you're like a thrill seeker

151
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:40,780
It's good to a good location for that. It's the

152
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:45,819
The clues that were given to me. We're definitely

153
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:53,919
Accurate because it smells pissy. It's just piss infected piss soaked it smells

154
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:01,959
It has an interesting artwork though. I didn't even get to find the

155
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:10,089
Hunt though because by the time I got in there I got freaked out by a partygoer from the Hollywood Bowl

156
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:18,009
And then continue to almost get trampled by the rest of them after that so it wasn't even worth it

157
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:24,548
So definitely I would say go if you want to

158
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,879
if you can stand the piss smell and

159
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:34,080
Also, check to see what's going on at the bowl check to see what's going on in the area

160
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,100
I'm out hunting again today

161
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,260
um

162
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:12,840
Last time I came out. I didn't find anything so I just decided that today I'm going to stay out here until I do

163
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:18,809
It's kind of a cloudy day today, but that's okay. It's not so hot that way

164
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,100
Um

165
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:23,910
Yeah, so

166
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:30,369
So far. I've found two today. They were really obvious though, so I just kind of lucked out I think

167
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,929
But not going to complain they're all over in this

168
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:38,859
Canyon here, so I'm just going to try and find as many as I can and

169
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:43,900
I hope you come with me. I gotta hurry though, because it's gonna get dark soon, so

170
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:02,860
I think there's one over here

171
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:27,080
So I know I'm probably overreacting but I could swear that that man or that woman

172
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,689
or whatever is following me

173
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:47,840
I'm trying to find the exit to the highway on this side. I think a lot of homeless people come out of here at night

174
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:14,680
Ok I can hear people walking on the trails. I just can't find them. Ridiculous.

175
00:55:19,829 --> 00:55:24,048
Shit great. I just drop the camera

176
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,920
How did I get in here?

177
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:40,230
You're gonna love this

178
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,900
in your closet

179
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:45,270
If you ever used it

180
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:48,119
There's a hole in there

181
01:02:48,369 --> 01:02:50,399
You'll never guess where that hole goes

182
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:55,160
my closet! hahahaha

183
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,240
Don't worry. I'm Gonna Share

184
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,460
What?

185
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,600
What ?

186
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:40,640
Always gotta know something well, what do you want to know?

187
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,740
Why are you doing this to me?

188
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:29,880
Do you know how stupid you are? You caught me

189
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:38,410
and then you went over there to me to get the boogie man out

190
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,340
hahaha

191
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,060
I am the boogie man.

192
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:49,100
Don't worry...you don't hear nothin. They don't care about you..

193
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:54,720
I wonder how long it's gonna take for your mommy and Daddy

194
01:04:56,579 --> 01:04:58,579
to notice you're gone

195
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:04,160
Oh wait. They're dead. That's right. They're gonna know right away hahahah

196
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,480
I just can't decide

197
01:05:21,089 --> 01:05:25,758
I mean, you should I tie a bag over your head and just sit and watch it burn out or

198
01:05:27,209 --> 01:05:29,209
Should I use a toy?

199
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,640
you ever fainted?

200
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,000
You're probably gonna

201
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Do that a few times tonight

202
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:43,610
and you're strong one, but

203
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,440
I'm gonna break you

204
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,440
You're gonna drift in and out

205
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:53,890
You know what this is?

206
01:05:54,809 --> 01:05:57,229
Haha, it's a fucking saw

207
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:03,549
Right.. little over here. Oh look at you. God

208
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:07,210
You are fun

209
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:09,799
You're good sport. You really are

210
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,400
You know girl?

211
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,710
You can only die once

212
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:25,380
I'm gonna help you be

213
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:33,159
Finally successful at something. You're gonna do this really really well. I'm gonna help you through the whole process

214
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:37,180
You might enjoy it

215
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,460
If you could have seen your face

216
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,600
