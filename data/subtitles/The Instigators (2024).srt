1
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:50,716
I can't talk about it.

2
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,053
Why not, Rory?

3
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,889
Well, I can tell you this.

4
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,476
I took a...
an honest look at my life,

5
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:05,565
and, the truth is,
I fucked things up, you know?

6
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,900
And I'm not blaming anyone,
I'm not feeling sorry for myself,

7
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,111
but that-that really is
the truth of the thing.

8
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,655
I fucked things up.

9
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,034
That's good.

10
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,079
How do you think you fucked things up?

11
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,584
It doesn't matter. It can't be fixed.

12
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,003
It matters.

13
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,462
Do you wanna fix things with your ex-wife?

14
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:32,301
No. No, she's not coming back. Um...

15
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:36,013
And... I don't blame her.
I mean, that's on me.

16
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,807
How about your son?

17
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,814
Why are you reluctant to talk?

18
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,358
Do you feel hopeless?

19
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,235
I feel fine.

20
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:54,197
Look, there just...
You know, I...

21
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:57,409
I can't answer some of these questions.
I'd put you in a bad spot.

22
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,163
Or you're gonna section me.
You're gonna put me in a bad spot.

23
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,664
Are you a danger to yourself?

24
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,875
Not today.

25
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,752
What does that mean, Rory?

26
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,837
Look, I'm doing what I'm supposed to do.

27
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,881
I'm doing all the right things,
and...

28
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:15,593
I figured out a while back...
it's not gonna get better.

29
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,595
And so I told myself,

30
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,307
"If this is how you still feel in a year,

31
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,645
then you could
cash in your ticket."

32
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,066
When did you come up with this plan?

33
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,570
It's about a year ago.

34
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,662
Rory?

35
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,207
Are you sure you've tried everything?

36
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,378
Not everything.

37
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,179
Big fucking man?

38
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,681
You think you're something?

39
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,392
Open your big fucking mouth
about our score?

40
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,436
What in baby Jesus's name
were you fucking thinking?

41
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,816
What happens when you shoot your mouth off
right before elections?

42
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,402
Got a hypothesis on that one?

43
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:18,489
You send flares up,
no one wants to fucking work.

44
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,242
Everyone's too afraid.

45
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,870
Now, I'm fucked.

46
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,955
Because I got this score?

47
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,374
A once-in-a-lifetime type of score,

48
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,795
and now I can't find a single goddamn soul
who wants to work

49
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,422
'cause of the fuckin' mess you made.

50
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,300
- I can fix it!
- How the fuck are you gonna do that?

51
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,219
I got guys. I got a whole crew.
We'll do it.

52
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,224
You work with loony tunes
who push mops in Quincy

53
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,518
and fuck everything up for everyone else.

54
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,647
Who in their right fucking mind
is gonna wanna do this job right now?

55
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,150
You gotta blow harder.

56
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,194
- Okay. I'm trying!
- Like a balloon. Put your lips on it.

57
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,196
Balloon.

58
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,991
<i>No alcohol detected.
Vehicle unlocked.</i>

59
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,492
Cobby Murphy!

60
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,786
- What on earth?
- All right.

61
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,747
Bring him back right now!

62
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,540
What are you looking at?
Go on. Get inside.

63
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,959
Cobby!

64
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:16,298
The next time you come around here,
I'm calling the cops.

65
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,229
- Terry. Hey.
- I don't want...

66
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,730
Yeah, you wanna hear a joke?

67
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:33,690
What?

68
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,901
You wanna hear a joke I heard today?
Terry. Wanna hear another one?

69
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:40,405
- Hello.
- Yo. Is Cobby Murphy there? It's Scalvo.

70
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,491
Cobby Murphy.
Put Cobby Murphy on the phone.

71
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,409
Hang on.

72
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,577
You don't got room for a joke?

73
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,496
Cobby!

74
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:50,414
What the fuck is it?
Jesus Christ.

75
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,749
Yeah?

76
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,085
The fuck is your problem?

77
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,628
You liked it up at Walpole?

78
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,922
You wanna go back?

79
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,131
Play grab-ass with all your friends?

80
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,760
Jesus. Calm down, Mr. Kelly.

81
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,848
- Hello.
<i>- I've got a big job.</i>

82
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,977
- Yeah.
- <i>If you want it, meet me in an hour.</i>

83
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:14,773
Um, yeah, all right. All right, bye.

84
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,988
If that was what I think it was,
then shove that keno card up your ass

85
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,448
and get out of my bar.

86
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,075
Fine.

87
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,201
Best of luck.

88
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,705
You know what?

89
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,295
I make my own luck.

90
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,009
Um,

91
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,802
Mr. Kelly?

92
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,640
You had anything, to drink today?

93
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,330
You Brenda's cousin? The marine?

94
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,375
- Yeah.
- What do you do now?

95
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:58,544
I sand floors.

96
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,129
You the ex-con?

97
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,839
The fuck does that mean?

98
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,341
Fuck does what mean?

99
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:08,594
Yeah, I did time, but you don't gotta
cast aspersions at me, guy.

100
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,638
What is this?
What's his fucking problem?

101
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,223
He's a stand-up guy. Kept his mouth shut.

102
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,475
Yeah, I'm a professional
fucking apologist, aren't I, Scalvo?

103
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,060
Hey, we took care of you, didn't we?

104
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,645
Yeah,
two to three in Walpole, prick.

105
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,022
- You had 18 months.
- Eighteen more than I fucking deserved.

106
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,983
Jesus Christ. Fuck me.

107
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,151
After a life in this business,

108
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,112
this is what I get
for my fucking troubles?

109
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,780
Bunch of Woody Woodpeckers over here...

110
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,323
A bunch of g...

111
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,868
You think that's fucking funny?

112
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,704
Doughnuts...

113
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,332
Now, I'm under the assumption

114
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,543
you're all aware of the fact
that in about a week,

115
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,964
the city of Boston's gonna be holding
a runoff for mayor.

116
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:48,759
Now, it's a foregone conclusion
that Miccelli will be reelected.

117
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,927
Every four years he wins.

118
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,139
Four more years, four more years.

119
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,099
Let's go!

120
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,642
And that party on election night

121
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:00,605
<i>is gonna be the be-all to end-all
of political graft-taking.</i>

122
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,524
<i>Five hundred just to get in the door.</i>

123
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,775
<i>Miccelli's old school.</i>

124
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,736
<i>Cash bar. Hundred a drink. No Venmo.</i>

125
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:10,114
<i>No PayPal.
No fucking crypto, Google bullshit.</i>

126
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,408
Cash.

127
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,868
<i>And everyone and anyone
who wants a contract's</i>

128
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,288
<i>gonna show up with a black fucking bag.</i>

129
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:21,335
And none of this is gonna be declared
to the Democratic Party of Massachusetts.

130
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,586
<i>So where's the party?</i>

131
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,172
<i>The Wharf.</i>

132
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,384
There's gonna be money there
like none of you shitbums ever seen.

133
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:33,095
And it'll remain there,
naked as the Lady in the Clam,

134
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,225
<i>till the armored truck
shows up in the morning.</i>

135
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,186
All right, so we're robbing the mayor.

136
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:42,438
In so many words.

137
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,732
How much?

138
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,735
Fifteen minutes of work.

139
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:52,908
Each of you
are looking at 10% of about 300,000.

140
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,245
- What if there's more?
- Then you get more.

141
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,412
And what if there's less?

142
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,874
Then you get less.
That's how a percentage works.

143
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,295
I need $32,480.

144
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,007
Well, I mean, I need a 15-inch cock,

145
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:12,176
but I'll tell you
the same thing God told me.

146
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,345
"Maybe next time."

147
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:15,848
All right. Nice knowing you guys.

148
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,727
How much you need?

149
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,690
$32,480. Exactly.

150
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,651
So, what if your cut is more?

151
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,318
You can keep it.

152
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,654
- Yeah?
- Yeah. But if it's less...

153
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,698
I know. You get your money no matter what.

154
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:34,783
Yeah.

155
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,745
- Deal.
- Deal.

156
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:41,665
Will you mind if I continue then?

157
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,836
<i>Go in from the water.</i>

158
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,924
<i>Under the docks, you tie up.</i>

159
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,926
<i>Head in up the back stairs.</i>

160
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,890
<i>Should be four or five guys in there
opening up, cleaning the place, whatever.</i>

161
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:02,477
Right off the kitchen is the office.
In here's the dough.

162
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,271
- Jackpot.
<i>- All goes well.</i>

163
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,940
<i>You cruise right on out of there.</i>

164
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,483
Scal here takes the dough.

165
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,653
That's the last we'll see of that.

166
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,280
Look. Okay? All right. Sit down.

167
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,073
All right, sit down.

168
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:20,287
One more fucking comment,
you go into the fucking drink.

169
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:26,210
Now, the two of you
get dropped off back at the docks.

170
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,294
Go about your business.

171
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:32,007
A couple of days,
you'll get a visit from Mr. DeChico.

172
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,425
That's Mr. DeChico.

173
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:39,389
After that, none of us
ever gotta see each other ever again.

174
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:42,643
Yeah, but what if Choi wins the runoff?

175
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,229
What if what?

176
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,980
Mark Choi, the challenger.

177
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,650
Not a relic of the past,
a vision for the future.

178
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,109
Ch-Choi. Choi for choice.

179
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,277
Same dirty tricks.

180
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,072
The same corruption
that we've seen over and over again.

181
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,241
- He's a hell of a candidate.
- Yeah, what if he wins?

182
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,326
- The Chinaman ain't gonna win.
- Listen, you don't gotta yell.

183
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,080
I'm just saying there's
a lot of unknown unknowns here.

184
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,542
Would you two excuse us for a moment?

185
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,423
Hey, you had the dough,
would you buy a yacht club?

186
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,677
Kind of a fucking smorgasbord
for douchebags, ain't it?

187
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,137
Hey, is that how
this kind of thing normally goes?

188
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,056
What do you mean?

189
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:23,308
Just... The whole thing in there.

190
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:24,977
This your first job?

191
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,229
I know what I'm doing.

192
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,399
Little late for a career change, ain't it?
What are you, 60?

193
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,776
Not changing careers.

194
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,571
What the fuck is this then?

195
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,739
It's... It's something I gotta do.

196
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,616
Once.

197
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,413
Don't turn this into another bag of dicks.

198
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,666
They don't touch the money.

199
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,459
Of course.

200
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,342
And you cut out that fucking idiot.

201
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,803
Be my pleasure.

202
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,807
Now, it's very complex,
so pay attention.

203
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:08,060
- We're gonna dock the boats here.
- This is a current, schematic?

204
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:08,979
Obviously.

205
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,146
We're gonna dock the boats here,

206
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,939
tie 'em up, head in
through the back stairwell.

207
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,110
- Here's the kitchen plan...
- Hey, is this the listing off of Zillow?

208
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,530
Can you just fucking listen
while I'm talking?

209
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:21,742
The fuck you doing?

210
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,328
Taking notes.

211
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:25,913
- Taking notes?
- Yeah...

212
00:12:25,914 --> 00:12:28,594
- On a criminal fucking conspiracy?
- It's a lot of information...

213
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,960
6:07. First stop of the morning.

214
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,963
Now these guys are armed,
and they're ready to be heroes.

215
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,591
Meaning we need to be outta there by 6:07.

216
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:39,842
6:07.

217
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,053
In case one of 'em decides
to be John Wayne for the day.

218
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:43,429
Okay.

219
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,348
Guard in the hopper
is carrying a four-inch .38.

220
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:46,682
There's another pistol in the truck

221
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,268
along with the 12-gauge resting
by the driver's side.

222
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,354
You know these guys?

223
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,606
- What?
- Do you know the guards?

224
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,316
No, I don't. Not personally.

225
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:58,402
You just intuitive like a Jedi? Like Yoda?

226
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,821
I did my research.

227
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:06,327
Restaurant manager of the Wharf.
Dave Wedge, 55 years old, two kids.

228
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,829
Pair of Labradors.
Went to culinary school.

229
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,540
Ten years at a trattoria downtown.

230
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,459
Lifelong pussy.
No way he's gonna get in our way.

231
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,461
Yeah.

232
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,171
No way.

233
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,506
Hey, you just shut the fuck up.

234
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,800
How the fuck do you know
how he's gonna react?

235
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,094
Culinary school? Are you serious?

236
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:24,887
You're giving us
a LinkedIn profile on a guy.

237
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:25,930
We're robbing a restaurant.

238
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,682
You're acting like we're in
<i>The Thomas Crown Affair</i>.

239
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:30,561
When we're done here, you and I,
we're gonna have a conversation.

240
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,896
What are you thinking, genius?

241
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,690
Nothing.

242
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,154
All right. It's time. We good?

243
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,282
Just one more.
Last one. Last one. I promise.

244
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,409
If I'm,

245
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,455
giving instructions and-and,
they're-they're not doing them...

246
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:54,001
Just say, "I have a gun."

247
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,798
Then that is what I'll do.

248
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,555
We're good. We're good.

249
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,460
Hey!

250
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,795
Take it easy, Scal.

251
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,964
You wanna fucking do it?

252
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,675
Nah, you're the captain.

253
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,553
You don't seem nervous.

254
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,223
That's 'cause I'm not. 6:07.

255
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:53,142
Are you all there? Like in your head?

256
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,436
Are you?

257
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,606
Nah, but I'm aware of that.

258
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:02,444
- Fuck was that? We're not moving.
- We're fucking stuck.

259
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:06,781
- Rock the fucking boat.
- Don't rock...

260
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:08,324
You're dragging it
across the rocks.

261
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,701
Trying to get us off.

262
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,120
Keep fucking rocking.

263
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,122
Jesus Christ. We're sinking.

264
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,041
Mayday, motherfucker. Mayday, cap.

265
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,709
- We're sinking, captain.
- Fuck!

266
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,753
Dying to swim in 15-degree water.

267
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,129
Yo, we-we got a lot of water.

268
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,298
Where'd you get
your boat captain license?

269
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,424
I want to take those classes.

270
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,510
What do you roll up halfway
and then you're like,

271
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:28,971
"Get out and walk, boys."

272
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,973
Well, at least it's January.

273
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,724
So, if we don't get the money, you know,

274
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,810
at least we'll all pick up pneumonia.
So, that's a win.

275
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,520
Shut the fuck up and focus.

276
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,814
It's just sewage, guys. Come on.

277
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:42,650
Staircase, mask, door, kitchen.
Get on the floor.

278
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,528
- Shut the fuck up. Put your mask on.
- Wedge, safe, money, 6:07.

279
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:46,988
- Three, two...
- 6:07.

280
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,949
Wait! Wait! Quick question. Last one.

281
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,493
Fuck your question.

282
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,494
Move! Get in the kitchen!

283
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:54,912
- Now! Move!
- Get on the floor!

284
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:58,417
Put your phones in the sink.
Get on the floor. Get on the...

285
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,419
Shit.

286
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:05,883
Fuck!

287
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,634
Tie 'em up.

288
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,553
We got like six zip ties, genius.

289
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:11,847
Well, fucking figure it out.

290
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:15,683
What the fuck are you doing?

291
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,019
Sorry. It's-It's my mom calling.

292
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,315
Take their fucking phones.

293
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,483
Get on the floor!
Put your phones in the sink.

294
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,651
Get on the floor.

295
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,529
Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.
My associate here, Mr. Longbaugh,

296
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,615
is gonna assist you
into the walk-in freezer.

297
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,701
Mr. Longbaugh, do you hurt people?

298
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,537
What?

299
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,998
Do you like to hurt people?

300
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,541
I have a gun!

301
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,586
Yes, you have a gun.

302
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,964
But you don't want
to have to use it, do you?

303
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:51,386
No,
I do not want to use this firearm at all.

304
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,641
Take a deep breath, get to your feet,

305
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:58,684
take out your phone,
put it on the counter.

306
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,104
- Move into the walk-in freezer. Come on.
- Walk-in freezer. Phones on the counter.

307
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,607
Phones on the counter.

308
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,108
Take whatever you need.
Plenty of food and beverages.

309
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,819
Everyone be nice to each other.
Do some jumping jacks.

310
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,030
- Stay warm.
- One at a time. All right.

311
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,865
- No one's gonna get hurt.
- I used to wash dishes, bro.

312
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,659
It was a fucking nightmare.
I used to work in a kitchen.

313
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,538
- It's like a men's locker room with food.
- There you go.

314
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,914
Hey, how come there's so many of you?

315
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,666
Event's still going from last night.
Everyone's going crazy because Choi won.

316
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:26,002
Make room. What?
Mark Choi won the election?

317
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,588
I thought he didn't stand a chance.

318
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,131
Miccelli hasn't conceded.

319
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,842
There's still tons of people out there.

320
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:33,427
- What the fuck?
- Hey, Mark Choi.

321
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,472
Told you he was a viable candidate.

322
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,269
Where is it? Where the fuck is it?

323
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,981
There was so much. We had, like,
two pickups already overnight.

324
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:45,941
Well, fill the fucking bag.

325
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,986
- With what?
- Just fucking fill it.

326
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,114
You want a smaller bag?

327
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:54,658
Where's all the money?

328
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:56,909
Fucking took it out last night
'cause there was so much of it.

329
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,078
- Wait. There's no money?
- No, there's no fucking money.

330
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,580
Get the fuck out!

331
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:01,915
Fuck!

332
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,838
- You put a gun on me, motherfucker?
- Hey. Don't. Enough. Enough.

333
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,464
Fuck this.

334
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,842
What the fuck is wrong with you?

335
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,598
You said it was a fucking lock.

336
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,266
I said the margin of error.

337
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,559
Fuck you.

338
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,311
You need to concede.

339
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:26,898
- The die-hards are getting out of hand.
- You need to shut the fuck up, Alan.

340
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,484
You know, like
the great Benjamin Franklin said,

341
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:34,198
"We must all hang together
because if we don't,

342
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,908
we most certainly will hang separate."

343
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:39,660
The mayor will be out any moment.

344
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:43,414
Please, let's give him
a warm welcome when he arrives.

345
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:48,127
Four more years!

346
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:53,216
When that vegan teetotaling
Chinese-American gets in my office

347
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,718
and does even the most casual accounting,

348
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,013
we're all going to fucking jail.

349
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,266
Right or left? Right or left?

350
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:05,895
Hey, are you sure
he had two Labradors?

351
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,563
I mean, you said
the guy was a lifelong pussy.

352
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,190
So, I'm thinking maybe
he only had one Labrador.

353
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,351
Nothing in this place
is like it is on this map.

354
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,987
Hey, Captain, is it possible
you got some of your research wrong?

355
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,197
Keep talking, cocksucker.

356
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,157
He definitely didn't
go to culinary school.

357
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,660
- Notes are smudged.
- Maybe like BU or some shit.

358
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,245
Shut the fuck up.

359
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,707
A right, then a right maybe?

360
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,796
Good.

361
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,882
Mr. Mayor. How are you?

362
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,717
Whoa.

363
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:37,927
Whoa.

364
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:40,930
Kid, we've got a world
of possibilities here, okay?

365
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,350
Shut the fuck up.
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

366
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,690
Empty your pockets, all of you, now.

367
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,568
Now! Take it all out.

368
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:54,777
- Fuck that bullshit. Let's go.
- Everything goes in the bag.

369
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,279
- Get their shit.
- Come on, man.

370
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,156
Go get their shit.

371
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,869
Everything. Jewelry, take it
the fuck out. Put it in the bag. Hurry up.

372
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,288
Sorry. In the bag.

373
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:08,163
- Get his watch in the bag.
- Yo, we don't have time for this shit.

374
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:17,300
Take it. Back there. Take his watch.

375
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,886
- My wife got me this. It's from Zales.
- In the bag.

376
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,767
Yeah, well,
you can afford another one.

377
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,891
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Thank you. In the bag.

378
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,726
Is that gold?

379
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:27,810
Thi... this?

380
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,645
- This is my grandfather's.
- Put it in the bag.

381
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:32,315
Listen, kid, I would
consider it a real personal favor...

382
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,858
Put it in the fucking bag!

383
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,152
Your Honor.

384
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,197
Thank you.

385
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,739
- Now let's go. Let's go.
- Come on.

386
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,950
- Let's go.
- What the fuck are you doing?

387
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,076
Kid, you don't wanna do this.

388
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,453
Don't fucking touch it.

389
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:47,038
What are you doing, man?

390
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,289
Let's go.

391
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,541
He's seen my fucking face.
They've all seen my face.

392
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:53,377
- Take care of this punk kid, Chief.
- Let's go. Let's go.

393
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,755
You got any idea what you're
involving yourself with right now?

394
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,090
- Try me.
- Drop the gun. Walk away.

395
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,634
Stop moving your fucking hands.

396
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,762
Motherfucker, if you shoot him,
you fuck us all.

397
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:04,597
We're just talking here.
That's all we're doin'.

398
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,140
- You turn around. We'll walk out.
- We're leaving right now.

399
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,976
- Just drop the gun.
- Don't let him get out of here.

400
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,311
- Do it, Chief.
- Drop the gun, walk away.

401
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,438
Yo, we're getting robbed back there.

402
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,482
Take him out.

403
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:21,739
Jesus.

404
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,492
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

405
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:25,493
Shit.

406
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,633
Come on. What are you doing?

407
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:47,516
Shit.

408
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:49,684
I'm okay.

409
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,446
It's 6:07.

410
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,284
Are you thinking about leaving me?

411
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:10,288
Fuck.

412
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,291
Sorry. 6:07.

413
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:20,381
Hello.

414
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,716
Hey!

415
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,552
Are these guys never fucking late?

416
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,636
Give me your keys.

417
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:29,933
Put your hands up.

418
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:49,911
No, no, no, I'll drive.

419
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:51,370
- Get in. I'm driving!
- I'll drive.

420
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,039
I'm driving...
Get in the goddamn vehicle!

421
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,291
You wanna leave me behind again?
Yeah, you wanna leave me?

422
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,918
- Christ.
- Come on, hurry up!

423
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,670
- Why the fuck are you driving?
- You know why. You know why.

424
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:02,632
I got two perfectly good arms.
I got two fucking arms.

425
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:03,966
You got one arm to drive with.

426
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,010
"6:07. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

427
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,595
Right turn. Right turn.

428
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:08,721
Go, go, go!

429
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:10,682
Wait, car! Look out!

430
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,394
You just hit a fucking police car.

431
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:16,562
Yeah, well, they got more.

432
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:19,023
Well, now they know to chase
the guys in the armored truck.

433
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,071
Horses? They think we just
robbed a train or something?

434
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:26,364
Watch it. Watch it.

435
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:28,366
Eyes on the road.

436
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,909
- I know what I'm doing.
- Take it easy.

437
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,494
Fuck. Take it easy?

438
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,535
I'm driving with one fucking arm,
for Christ's sake.

439
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,749
So let me drive. Switch with me.

440
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,670
So you can throw me out the door to
the fucking lions and never look back?

441
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:42,922
The wipers. Wipers.

442
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:44,549
No fucking wipers? You gonna help?

443
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,425
I got it. I got it. I got it.

444
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:49,053
Another advantage to having
two perfectly good arms.

445
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,686
- Shit.
- What?

446
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:59,856
Put on your seat belt.

447
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:00,982
Put on your seat belt.

448
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,400
Why are you whispering?

449
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:04,193
- Just put it on! Put it on...
- Why are you whispering?

450
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:07,072
- Put it on! Put it on!
- What the fuck?

451
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:14,204
The fuck!

452
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:21,961
What the fuck?

453
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:24,714
- Come on, come on!
- Hey! What are you doing?

454
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:34,777
- What the fuck happened?
- There's a guy back there.

455
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,267
There's a guy back there?

456
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:39,061
Yeah, I think there's
a guy back there.

457
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,982
- I feel like we would have...
- How many guys did you see?

458
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:43,567
How many what?

459
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:45,488
How many guys did you see
when we took the truck?

460
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,403
- I mean, there was the guy...
- I saw one.

461
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:49,156
Did you see one on the loading dock?

462
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:51,365
I don't f... How should I...

463
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,117
There's supposed to be two of them.
I only saw one.

464
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,202
- Well...
- So, where's the other guy?

465
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:55,870
So maybe there's just one guy this time.

466
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,121
Picking up money? No way.

467
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,956
Wait, so you're saying
one guy goes in and gets the money,

468
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:00,500
the other guy hides
in the back of the truck

469
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:03,044
- and fucking locks himself in there?
- Yeah. I think that's how they do it.

470
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:05,338
- I... That makes no sense.
- I think that's how they do it.

471
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,715
I think they put some fucking lunatic
in the back of the truck

472
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:08,799
and give him a loaded gun,

473
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,302
and they tell him anyone opens the door,
just fucking murder them.

474
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:12,983
And then they give him the Medal of Valor.

475
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:15,067
You're not getting
the Medal of Valor, John!

476
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,893
- You ever rob one of these things?
- No.

477
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:21,854
Look, I... I don't think
that's how they would do it.

478
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:24,649
Well, then what the fuck did I just hear
fall over in the back of the truck?

479
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,734
How the fuck should I know?
Maybe it was a big bag of money.

480
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:27,818
It wasn't a bag of money.

481
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,279
It was a fucking John Wayne who
fell over in the back of this truck,

482
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,760
who's sitting back there
waiting to blow our fucking heads off.

483
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:39,163
Come out with your hands up or
we're driving this thing into the water!

484
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:40,540
Think he's just waiting back there?

485
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:43,626
Yeah, because he fucking failed his...
his statie test

486
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:46,337
and so he went and got another job
where he could carry a gun

487
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:48,298
and murder someone and become a hero.

488
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,594
Hello? Is anybody in there?

489
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:54,762
I don't think that's gonna do it.

490
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:56,305
- I don't think there's anyone in there.
- We gotta run.

491
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:59,183
- There could be a lot of money in there.
- There's no fucking money in there.

492
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:00,394
I gotta see.

493
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:03,313
You are un-fucking-believable.

494
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,399
For $32,000?

495
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,192
We can't just... We can't just sit here.

496
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:09,861
You're gonna get shot in the face.

497
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:12,071
Just real quick. Real quick like...

498
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,447
It's not a matter of technique.

499
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,909
For fuck's sake.

500
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,995
Here we go.

501
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:23,750
All right, ready?

502
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:26,711
One, two...

503
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,588
- Wait, wait.
- Fuck me.

504
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:29,881
I just saved your fucking life.

505
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:31,674
He can hear us,
and he's gonna go off our count...

506
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:34,135
- He's not even in there.
- And you're gonna get shot in the face.

507
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:35,846
Sign. Sign.

508
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:37,847
Ready?

509
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:39,474
One.

510
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,810
Two, three.

511
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:47,440
- Fuck you!
- Shit. Holy shit!

512
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:48,900
- Are you hit? Did he get you?
- No, no.

513
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:52,403
I felt the bullet fucking whiz by my head.
Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ.

514
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,697
- Did I get him?
- No, you missed, you piece of shit.

515
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:56,616
I'm still here. I'm right-fucking-here.

516
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:58,826
Aw, you missed, you dumb son of a bitch.

517
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,829
You had your shot to be a hero,
and you fucking missed.

518
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,539
You let go of that fucking door,

519
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,833
and you better get
your guns up, motherfuckers.

520
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,210
'Cause I'm coming out with everything.

521
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:10,296
- So are we! You're dead, John!
- So are we! You're dead!

522
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,048
Fuck your mother!

523
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:13,758
I'm gonna fucking kill this guy.

524
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,426
I'm gonna fucking kill you, guy!

525
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:17,262
Then open the door, big boy.

526
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:18,680
Let's fuckin' do this!

527
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:20,848
It's the final three seconds
of your life, John.

528
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,600
Last three seconds of your life!

529
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:23,643
Say your prayers.

530
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:25,353
- All right, let's go!
- Last final three.

531
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:26,354
One!

532
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:40,826
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

533
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:41,994
I'm from Quincy.

534
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:45,207
Hot-wiring cars was
a part of the public school curriculum.

535
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,505
All right, move.

536
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,881
- I'm driving.
- No, just move over.

537
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:54,882
I'm driving. Get in.

538
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:01,138
Gotta go.

539
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:02,974
What the fuck is the deal
with you and the driving?

540
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:04,225
'Cause you'll leave me.

541
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:05,434
Fuck would I leave you for?

542
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,894
Yeah. I heard that song before, bro.

543
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:08,563
You can't even
fucking put the car in gear.

544
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:10,315
- Adios. Adios.
- Put it in drive.

545
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,282
So, what do you want me to do here?

546
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:26,623
We robbed the mayor.
It didn't exactly go so well.

547
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:32,004
So, I need... We need
the two shitbums from Quincy...

548
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:35,799
fucking gone, yeah?

549
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:37,466
Dead.

550
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:40,469
The fuck am I supposed to do?
They're in the wind.

551
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,889
Have a nice day.

552
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:48,186
Call that, psychopath
Scalvo worked with.

553
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:50,313
The other fucking lunatic.

554
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:52,148
Who? Booch?

555
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:53,983
Have him clean this shit up.

556
00:28:53,984 --> 00:28:57,612
Fucking his and Scalvo's fault
we're in this shit the first place.

557
00:28:57,613 --> 00:29:00,324
Fucking useless cocksucker!

558
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:02,659
Have him find them.

559
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,120
Get the money.

560
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:07,455
I'm going to my cabin.

561
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:13,170
Let's not, lose sight of the fact...
we robbed the fucking mayor.

562
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,103
Who smoked
the police commissioner?

563
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:32,856
Don't worry about that, Francis.

564
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:36,443
Let's let the animals
who work here handle that.

565
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:39,529
I...

566
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:44,075
called you in for a special task force.

567
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:45,493
Who's on it?

568
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:47,078
Just you, Francis.

569
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:51,959
My grandfather's bracelet
kind of got lost in the shuffle.

570
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:54,169
A bracelet?

571
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,254
Hizzoner is a family man.

572
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:57,672
Sentimental value and all.

573
00:29:57,673 --> 00:30:00,508
- You understand, Frank?
- What do you want me to do?

574
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:03,136
Yeah, I mean,
whatever it is you do, Frank.

575
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,307
That's what you do here.

576
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:15,774
Need anything from us?

577
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:22,905
How in the hell is any of this my problem?

578
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:25,783
You and your boss,
y-you guys didn't even want me on the job.

579
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:27,368
It's 'cause you're ignorant, Booch.

580
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:29,579
So, what do you want from me?

581
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,706
You want me to help you
make your flan or whatever?

582
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:34,834
Find the two guys your buddy hired
and put them down before they can talk.

583
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,295
Find them where?

584
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:39,547
They're probably halfway
to Montreal by now.

585
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:47,723
It's a yellow house.

586
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:51,559
Who the fuck are you calling?

587
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,394
Um, I wanna get my money.

588
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:54,730
What are you gonna say?

589
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:58,274
"There's no money. Your friend is dead,
but I still want my 50 grand"?

590
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:01,277
32,480. That was the deal.

591
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:02,320
That's it.

592
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:03,989
I don't know what to tell you.

593
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,366
Mr. B's gonna wanna kill you.

594
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,869
You know, loose ends and everything.

595
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,163
Richie, you seem like a decent guy,

596
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:16,376
but I will rip your dick off with
my bare hands straight off the FUPA,

597
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,836
and I will chuck it in a fucking river.

598
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:20,923
No need for that kind of talk.

599
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:28,764
Please don't say anything specific.

600
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,726
You gotta be shitting me. Yeah?

601
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:35,061
<i>Hi. Um,</i>

602
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:40,274
I am calling, about
an order that I placed this morning.

603
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:41,734
There was a problem.

604
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:43,402
What's the problem?

605
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:45,488
The cake was all smashed up.

606
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:47,323
There were no candles on it.

607
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:51,160
Um, someone... someone
shot the fucking cupcake.

608
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:54,121
Yeah, enough with the cake business, pal.
What the fuck's going on?

609
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:56,582
<i>Look, Scalvo's dead.
Cobby got shot.</i>

610
00:31:56,583 --> 00:32:00,127
I-I need my cut.
And you gotta fucking fix this.

611
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:02,421
Okay. Where are you?

612
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:06,968
Salisbury Beach, Rincone Lane.
It is the only yellow house.

613
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,219
Just sit tight.

614
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,429
We're sending a doctor.

615
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:12,640
It's your lucky day.

616
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:22,692
Mr. Kelly's place.

617
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:24,194
Who's Mr. Kelly?

618
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,321
He runs my bar.

619
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:28,907
You own a bar?

620
00:32:28,908 --> 00:32:31,201
Nah. He... He owns it. I just drink there.

621
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:34,997
I guess it's his bar.

622
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:02,232
Coffee.

623
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,332
I heard about your pal Scalvo.

624
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,459
Was he a handsome guy?

625
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:25,172
I couldn't tell with his head blown off.

626
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:28,383
I just make the doughnuts.

627
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:31,220
I don't know shit.

628
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:34,056
But you know some shitheads, right?

629
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:41,063
See, my problem is, something important
was taken in the shuffle at the Wharf.

630
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:42,689
Shuffle?

631
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,149
Gold bracelet.

632
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:48,152
Look, Detective. I'm just a baker.

633
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:52,323
Unless this is a... an official
interrogation, I've got work to do.

634
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,076
Richie, Richie, please.

635
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,205
A cop was shot and killed.

636
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:01,750
I show up at your door after that.

637
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:07,422
And ain't nothing holding my chain.

638
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,176
Do what you're gonna do, Frank.

639
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:23,105
This is what he's got.

640
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,399
Thanks.

641
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,025
It's warm.

642
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:29,734
Yeah, it's not my house.

643
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:33,949
- Let me take a look.
- Go easy.

644
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:37,286
That hurts.

645
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,035
What are you doing?

646
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,913
- I'm trying to see the other side.
- What are you doing?

647
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:42,039
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hang on.

648
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:44,959
I don't... I don't see an exit wound.

649
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,294
What do you do for that?

650
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:48,588
Take it out.

651
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:50,549
Fuck. All right, go ahead.

652
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,759
I'm... I'm not gonna fuck with it.

653
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:55,636
Wait. I thought you were a marine.

654
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:57,346
Yeah, I was a mechanic.

655
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:58,389
Fantastic.

656
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,807
We'll wait for the doctor.

657
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:03,020
I guess I'll drink a case
of warm beer and bleed out.

658
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:14,573
Mr. Kelly owns a bar. You'd think
he'd have better beer than this.

659
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:24,540
This guy's got a stack of ones.

660
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:29,129
What the fuck?

661
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:41,140
<i>They stole someone's bracelet.</i>

662
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:43,476
Evidently it has some value.

663
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:47,855
Okay, well, if it's got value,
then why would I hand it over to you then?

664
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,315
You know why you're gonna give it to me?

665
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:50,816
Because somebody else who wants it?

666
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:52,027
Frank fucking Toomey.

667
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:58,574
Frank Too... All right.
Understood. All yours.

668
00:35:58,575 --> 00:35:59,826
Real smart, Booch.

669
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,745
Real fucking smart.

670
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:19,762
When we were driving,
you see those horses chasing us?

671
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:21,473
I always wanted to be a cowboy.

672
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:30,482
Good talk. Cowboy?

673
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:32,359
Yeah.

674
00:36:33,277 --> 00:36:34,610
What'd you wanna be?

675
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:39,782
Teacher. How come?
I like kids. Get the summers off.

676
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:41,742
Feel like we're getting
to know each other better.

677
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:44,120
Sitting around a beach house.
What else is there to do than talk?

678
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:45,538
I don't know. Maybe I'll ignore you

679
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:48,959
and take a long romantic stroll
on the beach by myself.

680
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:52,087
Yeah, do that.
I'll lay here and bleed to death.

681
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:55,007
Hey, do you ever laugh?

682
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:57,300
No.

683
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:58,718
Well, you should try it.

684
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:01,471
Life will fuck you up.
And a laugh's all you got.

685
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:05,726
For example,
nicest thing I ever did in my whole life,

686
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:09,188
which is now coming to an end,
so I can say this...

687
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:12,941
Nicest thing I ever did
got me locked up for three years.

688
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:15,318
Fucking guys.

689
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:17,195
They got my little brother using.

690
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:19,031
They put him on a job.

691
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:22,326
Of course, the job goes bad.

692
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:28,080
Fucking Scalvo leaves him on a corner,
holding the bag.

693
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:30,791
Poor kid's already got two strikes on him.

694
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,628
So, he would have got like eight to ten.

695
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,088
But we looked exactly alike.

696
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:36,882
So, I said it was me.

697
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:40,301
I'm sure he appreciated that.

698
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:42,012
Yeah, I'm sure he did.

699
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:44,389
But he OD'd while I was inside.

700
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:47,683
And you're doing this for them?

701
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:48,977
Isn't that hilarious?

702
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:51,938
So, what's with the 32,000?

703
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:53,398
It's just what I need.

704
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,529
Yeah, but why specifically 32,480?

705
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:03,825
Because I can't see my son.

706
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,123
Why can't you see your son?

707
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:16,796
Lawyer fees and back child support,
a mortgage, school fees,

708
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:21,133
a loan for used hockey equipment
for 10% interest.

709
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:25,346
Believe me, I know
specifically what the fucking numbers are.

710
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:27,182
But you could still see him.

711
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:29,434
Couldn't look him in the eye.

712
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,982
Kids don't give a shit about the money.

713
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:38,067
I mean, like,
the best memory of my whole life

714
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:43,532
is me and my brother
sitting on a stoop in a snowstorm.

715
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,118
Whole street blanketed...

716
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:52,707
city gone quiet, just listening
to the snow fall on snow.

717
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:55,544
It's like silence, but better.

718
00:38:57,087 --> 00:39:00,631
You don't come across as someone
who appreciates silence.

719
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:02,134
Just saying the money doesn't matter.

720
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:05,554
What matters is showing up
and watching the kid play hockey.

721
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:14,604
- Yeah?
- Heard you need a doctor.

722
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:16,939
- You're a doctor?
- Yeah, sure.

723
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,191
I'm his nurse practitioner.

724
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:20,652
All right. Hang on.

725
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:25,948
Hey, yo, I don't think they sent a doctor.

726
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:27,284
Hey, fuckface.

727
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:31,455
Booch, how was med school?

728
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:35,791
Everything I did for those pricks,
and they send you.

729
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:37,336
Where's the fucking take?

730
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:39,171
Show this man his winnings.

731
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,261
- Hey, how are you? All right.
- Hey, Cobby, how are you?

732
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:51,265
The fuck? What is this, a stripper stack?

733
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,226
There's only a couple grand.
There was no money there.

734
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:55,561
There's a nice gold watch, Booch.
From Zales.

735
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:57,480
It'll match your jacket.

736
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:04,320
Shit. Jackpot. Look at this, Colani.

737
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:06,239
Holy fucking shit.

738
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,700
All right, you two dumb fucks.
Both of you, on your knees.

739
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:11,911
Booch, you trying to be dramatic?

740
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:14,580
I got it from here. You go wait outside.

741
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:17,251
Wow, you're my fucking hero,
you know that?

742
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:20,711
I know you're being fa...
What's the word you use? Facetious?

743
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:22,421
- Fatecious.
- F... Get the fuck out of here.

744
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:25,132
Yeah, fuck off. Stupid fuck, you smell.

745
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,676
Fuck your mother.

746
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:27,928
Fuck your mother.

747
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:31,556
Both of you smart guys, take a knee.

748
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:33,391
Nobody's taking a knee, Booch.

749
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:34,684
The fuck you are not.

750
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:36,894
- Both of you take a fucking knee.
- Whoa, whoa.

751
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:39,857
Come on, you don't smell it?
He can't smell it.

752
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:48,239
There's so much gas
in this house right now.

753
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,034
You pull the trigger on that gun,
we're all going up like the Challenger.

754
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:54,662
Yeah, you're not really doing
the math here. You can't shoot either.

755
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:56,707
I'm already dying. It doesn't matter.

756
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:58,708
Give us your car keys.

757
00:40:58,709 --> 00:40:59,959
You don't want to take my car.

758
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,086
Get his keys.

759
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:06,800
Get the gun.

760
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:08,301
You said the keys.

761
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:11,470
Yeah, get both. Take that bracelet too.

762
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:13,932
This guy hold your dick when you piss?

763
00:41:16,518 --> 00:41:18,060
Booch, you're so stupid.

764
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:20,105
You couldn't kill me,
and I was already shot.

765
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:22,899
You are gonna fuck this up.
You know that, right?

766
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,195
I might. But I'm fucking you up
right now, Booch.

767
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:28,979
All right.

768
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:32,075
F...

769
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:36,621
That was unbelievable.

770
00:41:36,622 --> 00:41:37,872
Hey, new guy.

771
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:40,666
How far do you think you're gonna get
with a partner who's shot to shit?

772
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,960
- I heard they got troopers...
- I can't believe they bought that shit.

773
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:45,004
Coming all the way from Vermont
to fuck you guys up!

774
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:54,640
You didn't think that was funny?

775
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,363
You okay?

776
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:12,782
- No, I'm not okay.
- Hey, you're okay.

777
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:15,034
<i>How's it going up there?</i>

778
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:19,830
- I'm freezing my fucking bag off.
- The oil... The oil ran out.

779
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:24,460
I was outside in my goddamn
fucking chinos and alligators,

780
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:28,423
splitting logs in the fucking snow,
and the temperature's dropping.

781
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:31,218
Um, Toomey came by.

782
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:35,514
How bad?

783
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:37,473
It's bad.

784
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:39,393
Jesus Christ.

785
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:42,396
Guess who he's looking for?

786
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,438
Fuck you, Richie.

787
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:46,400
Two gentlemen from Quincy.

788
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:50,112
<i>They took something from the mayor.</i>

789
00:42:51,113 --> 00:42:53,573
Something he wants back real bad.

790
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:55,825
There's something else, though.

791
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:58,035
Richie, I'm gonna have
a fucking panic attack,

792
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:59,830
you don't finish your
fucking sentence here.

793
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,708
We didn't make any money off the,
you know...

794
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:08,921
Goddamn motherfucker!

795
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:10,382
Goddamn it!

796
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:24,021
You came back to Boston
in a stolen car?

797
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:26,939
Christ, you really must be crazy.

798
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:32,111
You know, for a moment there...
it was so nice and quiet.

799
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:35,199
I actually thought you were dead.

800
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,950
Now, I gotta go through with this.

801
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:39,328
Through with what?

802
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,748
Fuck you gonna do?

803
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,709
You never talk to me...

804
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:49,171
I gotta speak to you.
Um, it's an emergency.

805
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:51,589
- I'm with a patient.
- Yeah, excuse me.

806
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,341
You have an MD, right?

807
00:43:53,342 --> 00:43:54,259
Hey, pal...

808
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,178
- We're good, we're good.
- It's okay. Rory, wait outside.

809
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,471
I really need you right now, Doc.

810
00:43:58,472 --> 00:43:59,932
Wait outside.

811
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,476
- I'm so sorry.
- All right.

812
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,145
It's, time-sensitive.

813
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:14,904
It's a gunshot to the shoulder.

814
00:44:14,905 --> 00:44:16,739
The bullet's still in.

815
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,245
Hi.

816
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:24,872
Was that you in the news?

817
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:26,249
- The mayor?
- Yeah, yeah.

818
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,667
A police officer was killed.

819
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:28,960
I... We tried to stop that.

820
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:30,670
As a matter of fact,
that guy shot me.

821
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:33,673
So, in all fairness,
I'm also a victim.

822
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:35,591
You need to call 911.

823
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:38,427
Look... they're gonna
arrest him, then they're gonna arrest me,

824
00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:40,304
and neither of us
are gonna make it to the fucking trial.

825
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:42,223
- He needs a doctor.
- You're a doctor.

826
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:44,767
I just need you to take
the bullet out, patch him up,

827
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:46,519
and we are on our way. We're gone.

828
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,274
If I did what you're asking, Rory,
I would be... I would be breaking the law.

829
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:57,364
What if I took you hostage?

830
00:44:58,198 --> 00:44:59,699
No, I mean with your permission.

831
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,743
Like then officially, legally,
you'd be my hostage,

832
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:04,495
and you have to do what I say.

833
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:06,081
He's really hurt.

834
00:45:11,545 --> 00:45:13,254
- You won't hurt anyone?
- No.

835
00:45:13,255 --> 00:45:15,007
- You won't hurt yourself?
- No.

836
00:45:16,008 --> 00:45:17,508
And you will turn yourself in?

837
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:20,636
After I do what I gotta do,
I will turn myself in.

838
00:45:20,637 --> 00:45:23,098
And I am your hostage, we're clear?

839
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:26,559
- Great. All right, get in.
- No, you have to say it, Rory.

840
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,768
Fine. You are my hostage.

841
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:29,687
Say you will kill me if I don't help you.

842
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:31,397
I don't have a choice?

843
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:32,815
You have a choice.

844
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:34,359
You're making a choice.

845
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:38,279
You're a grown man.
You're accountable for your decisions.

846
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,741
- You're making a decision right now.
- Fine. I will...

847
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:43,660
I will kill you if you don't help me.

848
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:46,413
Good.

849
00:45:46,414 --> 00:45:48,832
What the fuck
kind of conversation is this?

850
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:50,542
You're gonna love him.

851
00:45:57,049 --> 00:45:58,300
Okay.

852
00:45:59,928 --> 00:46:01,845
God, not the couch.

853
00:46:02,346 --> 00:46:03,805
On the table.

854
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:09,269
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Hang on, hang on.

855
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:14,650
All right.

856
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:18,487
That lady a doctor?

857
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:20,780
Yeah.

858
00:46:20,781 --> 00:46:22,783
What kind of doctor?

859
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:24,701
Don't worry about it.

860
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:28,579
Hey... have you done
this kind of thing before?

861
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,748
No, but I did junior residency

862
00:46:30,749 --> 00:46:32,917
in the ER at Beth Israel
if that's what you're asking.

863
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:34,127
What are you whispering about?

864
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:40,383
Honestly, gunshot wounds
were my favorite. I like finding them.

865
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:42,134
Good.

866
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:44,972
Hi. How's your day going?

867
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:46,974
It's shot.

868
00:46:48,225 --> 00:46:49,268
I'm Dr. Rivera.

869
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:52,645
- Do you mind if I take a look at you?
- Have your way with me.

870
00:46:56,233 --> 00:46:57,484
Okay.

871
00:46:58,735 --> 00:47:00,027
That's the hole.

872
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:07,119
You have a good energy.

873
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,872
He saved my life.

874
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:13,542
How did that make you feel
when he did that?

875
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:15,210
Is that clean?

876
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:17,170
Yeah, pretty good.

877
00:47:17,171 --> 00:47:18,838
Well, it must have been comforting

878
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:21,800
to have that kind of support
in such a scary environment.

879
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:25,804
Tell me about that.

880
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:29,057
Miccelli's gotta go!
Clean up crime!

881
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:33,845
I've tried every combination
of numbers I can think of.

882
00:47:34,731 --> 00:47:37,565
If they don't open up this safe now,
I'm fucked.

883
00:47:37,566 --> 00:47:41,277
And if I'm fucked, you think I'm gonna let
anybody walk around this city unfucked?

884
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:44,197
They're sharpening up their knives
to stick in my back, Alan!

885
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:47,241
We just need t-time and... and luck.

886
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:49,202
Luck? They're throwing us out, Alan.

887
00:47:50,662 --> 00:47:52,371
Anything?

888
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:54,165
Miccelli's got to go!

889
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:57,126
They better get in that safe, Alan.
For your sake, for mine, for everybody.

890
00:47:57,669 --> 00:48:01,047
Yes, well, we're all operating
on that assumption, sir.

891
00:48:01,048 --> 00:48:04,759
Hey, Victoria,
did they try 26 instead of 28?

892
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,178
Yes, sir.

893
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:09,222
Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened
to the city of Boston?

894
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:12,726
You can't find one motherfucker
to crack a motherfucking safe?

895
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:23,237
I saw the tarp,
I thought somebody was gonna chop me up.

896
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,990
Still might.

897
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:29,825
Hey, look, you made a joke.

898
00:48:29,826 --> 00:48:32,119
She left you a sweatshirt on the table.

899
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,162
We gotta go.

900
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:34,747
Did you get her phone?

901
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:36,375
She's all right. She's...

902
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:42,256
I mean, we made a deal.

903
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:46,927
You just have to...

904
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:51,514
<i>Squad car
should be arriving any second now.</i>

905
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:53,516
Am I gonna be disappointed?

906
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:55,977
State police are willing to negotiate.

907
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:58,229
I told them that I was your hostage.

908
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,148
And that, also as your doctor,
you are a credible 851,

909
00:49:01,149 --> 00:49:02,567
which means that you have expressed

910
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:05,319
suicidal ideation with
underlying mental health issues

911
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,614
and-and that you were pressed
into participating in the robbery.

912
00:49:09,658 --> 00:49:11,200
What are you feeling?

913
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:13,077
I'm disappointed.

914
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:15,371
- Hey, give me back my keys.
- Thanks for the sweatshirt.

915
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:19,584
- Rory, this was the deal.
- No. I said after I did what I had to do.

916
00:49:19,585 --> 00:49:21,627
- I'm not gonna let you kill yourself...
- Hurry up.

917
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:22,962
Or get yourself killed.

918
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:26,048
Yeah, except you just told
an army of angry cops where we are.

919
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:28,677
I did not. I called
a major in the state police.

920
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:31,554
Rory, I counsel the state police.
They wouldn't lie to me.

921
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:33,682
Did you hear that?
You gotta think that's funny.

922
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:36,601
- They wanna negotiate.
- They think we're cop killers.

923
00:49:36,602 --> 00:49:37,852
- You are!
- No, we're not.

924
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:38,978
That was the other guy.

925
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:40,563
They're gonna hunt us down like Regret.

926
00:49:40,564 --> 00:49:42,356
You're gonna be directly
responsible for us dying.

927
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:45,109
Excuse me?
Excuse me, I saved your life.

928
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,028
Yeah. So someone else could kill us?

929
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:48,739
Fuck.

930
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:51,574
- What is an 851?
- That is not what I'm doing.

931
00:49:51,575 --> 00:49:53,993
- You trying to kill yourself?
- You gave me your word.

932
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:55,203
You gave me your word.

933
00:49:55,204 --> 00:49:56,746
Nobody keeps their word.
Are you trying to kill yourself?

934
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:57,788
Rory, you have to trust me.

935
00:49:57,789 --> 00:49:59,290
No. I have to do what I have to do.

936
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,791
I gotta make it right.

937
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:03,544
I said I was gonna do that,
then I was gonna turn myself in.

938
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:04,754
I will keep my word.

939
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:06,089
Maybe I should drive.

940
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:08,925
- Get in the car.
- Just considering everything...

941
00:50:08,926 --> 00:50:10,259
- Get in the car.
- All right. Fuck it.

942
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,637
Rory.

943
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:22,104
- What are you doing?
- I am not letting you die.

944
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:23,815
I can't.

945
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:27,136
Things are getting better in here.

946
00:50:37,454 --> 00:50:39,580
Look, our negotiators.

947
00:50:39,581 --> 00:50:42,101
- You think this is funny?
- It's not not funny.

948
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:54,388
- Go back, back, back, back.
- I'm trying to stop it.

949
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:19,495
<i>Put your hands in the air.</i>

950
00:51:19,496 --> 00:51:21,039
<i>Get out of the car.</i>

951
00:51:21,665 --> 00:51:22,666
<i>Now!</i>

952
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:29,965
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

953
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:47,857
Wow. Those cops from Rhode Island?

954
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:49,775
Don't they have anything
going on in their own state?

955
00:51:49,776 --> 00:51:51,528
How'd they get here so fast?

956
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,114
First on the scene.

957
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:57,283
I guess if you're the smallest state,
you got nothing to do.

958
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:59,744
Rory, you are driving recklessly.

959
00:51:59,745 --> 00:52:01,914
I'm in the middle of
a high-speed car chase.

960
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,751
Think about the progress we were making.

961
00:52:06,752 --> 00:52:08,669
Think about the person you wanted to be.

962
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,296
What kind of person did you want to be?

963
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:11,672
- Ask yourself.
- Please change the song.

964
00:52:11,673 --> 00:52:15,009
Rory, ask yourself how
any of this is helping you.

965
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,304
- Is this your playlist?
- Please change the song.

966
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,847
- I didn't pick it!
- Okay.

967
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:22,475
Usually the driver picks the song.

968
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:25,478
Punch a button. I don't care.
Just change it.

969
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:26,604
There you go.

970
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:33,236
- Rory, you're in crisis.
- No, I'm not.

971
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:36,031
The situation is a crisis. I'm fine.

972
00:52:36,657 --> 00:52:38,824
Wow. Look at all
those negotiators over there.

973
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:40,451
They look like they're
ready to make a deal.

974
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:43,829
Rory, you are betraying everything
you have ever told me you wanted to be.

975
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,207
What did you want to be?
You're a shrink?

976
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:48,376
My Christ, my fucking Lord.

977
00:52:48,377 --> 00:52:49,418
You got a shrink?

978
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:51,504
I thought you operated on me.
You're not even a real doctor.

979
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:53,631
- What?
- Bro, you wanna kill yourself?

980
00:52:53,632 --> 00:52:54,800
Hey, where are you from?

981
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:58,345
- I'm from Lynn.
- Yeah. That makes sense.

982
00:53:00,347 --> 00:53:01,682
What does that mean?

983
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:03,850
You're from Lynn? The city of sin?

984
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:05,852
- Yeah, I'm from Lynn. Where are you from?
- I dated a girl from Lynn.

985
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:07,813
I liked you better when you were crying.

986
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:17,029
How are you a psychiatrist
and you make fun of people for crying?

987
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,406
- I was not...
- Which I didn't even do.

988
00:53:18,407 --> 00:53:20,283
I'm not making fun of anyone.
I was talking to you because...

989
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:21,868
Why you pay somebody to
make fun of you for crying?

990
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:23,744
You're not my patient,
and you're being disrespectful.

991
00:53:23,745 --> 00:53:25,872
You know what? Just drive us
off the bridge. Take us all out.

992
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:28,542
I wouldn't want to be shamed
for expressing feelings.

993
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:31,628
<i>Cut him off on the other side.
Cut him off!</i>

994
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:50,188
Rory, you have to stop.
You have to face your problems.

995
00:53:50,189 --> 00:53:52,940
Yeah, I'm gonna lobby for
not stopping the car.

996
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:54,442
Those are Vermont State Troopers.

997
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:56,611
They're all goddamn leaning on us,
following us...

998
00:53:56,612 --> 00:53:58,905
- Hey, which way?
- Take 93.

999
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:00,489
Ninety... Ninety-three?

1000
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:01,908
<i>All units, be aware.</i>

1001
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:03,701
<i>The suspect's vehicle
has entered the tunnel.</i>

1002
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:06,288
- Coming up on the right.
- Cut him off!

1003
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:11,335
Shit.

1004
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:25,307
If we survive this, would you
consider having a cup of coffee with me?

1005
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:28,435
Do not fuck with me.

1006
00:54:29,228 --> 00:54:30,229
Is that a no?

1007
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:46,453
Go, go, go, go, go.

1008
00:54:58,423 --> 00:55:00,583
- What is wrong with you?
- Go back to fucking Vermont!

1009
00:55:04,263 --> 00:55:06,222
- I think we're good.
- Hey, go to Quincy.

1010
00:55:06,223 --> 00:55:08,307
Quincy. Quincy. Quincy. Quincy.

1011
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:09,684
Right there.

1012
00:55:09,685 --> 00:55:10,726
Go to my bar.

1013
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:12,187
Wait, you own a bar?

1014
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:15,742
Why is that so hard
for everyone to believe?

1015
00:55:17,276 --> 00:55:19,193
For the purpose of my insurance claim,

1016
00:55:19,194 --> 00:55:21,153
I'd like you to make sure
the car is totaled.

1017
00:55:21,154 --> 00:55:22,780
- Yeah.
- You're probably good.

1018
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:24,324
Think we got you covered.

1019
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:36,420
Time to go.

1020
00:55:36,421 --> 00:55:38,504
Thirty fucking years
in this business.

1021
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:42,341
I can't believe I'm running to Canada
'cause of Cobby fucking Murphy.

1022
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:44,802
He cannot keep his big fucking mouth shut.

1023
00:55:44,803 --> 00:55:46,637
Except when he did for us in Walpole.

1024
00:55:46,638 --> 00:55:48,848
What do you think he's gonna do
when Toomey catches him?

1025
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:51,726
- He'll roll on us for sure.
- Yeah, you bet your ass he'll roll on us.

1026
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:54,437
He'll sing like Billie fucking Holliday.

1027
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:56,857
This cabin is not far enough.

1028
00:55:57,733 --> 00:55:59,275
Well, I love maple syrup.

1029
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:00,694
Neil Young.

1030
00:56:01,862 --> 00:56:02,863
Ice hockey.

1031
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:05,239
Walking around outside.

1032
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,576
Can you love all that in fucking French?

1033
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,280
What?

1034
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:12,956
Au revoir.

1035
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:15,542
What... What the hell?

1036
00:56:16,627 --> 00:56:18,544
That works.

1037
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:20,505
- You gotta go in and around to the right.
- Yeah, perfect.

1038
00:56:20,506 --> 00:56:23,132
- Another crime.
- Yeah, you're on a roll.

1039
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:24,717
You didn't tell me
it was a bathroom.

1040
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:26,344
- It's a bathroom.
- Fuck.

1041
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:32,391
Um, this man, Mr. Kelly, why wouldn't
he call the cops on you immediately?

1042
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:34,185
'Cause I'm like the son he never had.

1043
00:56:34,186 --> 00:56:36,103
Son he never had or never wanted?

1044
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:37,939
You know,
you don't seem like a doctor to me.

1045
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,525
Well, are you bleeding to death?

1046
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:42,443
That's a good point.
But so, what do you do?

1047
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:45,863
Can you prescribe medication or you just,
like, talk Rory off a ledge once a week?

1048
00:56:45,864 --> 00:56:48,115
You really think I'm gonna talk
to you about confidential patients?

1049
00:56:48,116 --> 00:56:50,576
Nah, but I'm just saying, like,
don't these guys need real treatment?

1050
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:52,620
Can't see a whole village
of helpless little kids

1051
00:56:52,621 --> 00:56:55,248
get annihilated by a SCUD missile
or whatever and then be like,

1052
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:56,833
"tell me about your childhood,
and you'll be fine."

1053
00:56:56,834 --> 00:57:00,211
Okay, first of all, you're an idiot.

1054
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:03,381
Second of all,
Rory receives excellent treatment.

1055
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:07,094
And lastly, I have an MD, which is
what you need to prescribe medication.

1056
00:57:08,554 --> 00:57:10,681
Okay. I did not know that.

1057
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:14,183
Thank God.

1058
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:21,899
If I was your patient,
you think you could figure me out?

1059
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,484
You wouldn't be my patient.

1060
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:25,653
I'm just saying, if you had to though,
or whatever.

1061
00:57:25,654 --> 00:57:28,156
There's no "have to."
I keep healthy boundaries.

1062
00:57:28,657 --> 00:57:29,824
Yeah.

1063
00:57:29,825 --> 00:57:31,450
Like running around
with a couple lowlifes,

1064
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:33,494
- pretending to be a hostage?
- You're not a lowlife, Rory.

1065
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:35,746
As soon as this Mr. Kelly guy gets here,

1066
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:37,582
we just take whatever help he can give us.

1067
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:38,500
Rory...

1068
00:57:38,501 --> 00:57:42,253
And then I'm gonna do what I gotta do,
and then I turn myself in.

1069
00:57:42,254 --> 00:57:44,298
I guess I'll go down to Bolivia
all by myself.

1070
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:55,556
Is that Mr. Kelly?

1071
00:57:56,435 --> 00:57:59,188
Does Mr. Kelly drive a tank?

1072
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:07,236
Shit.

1073
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:09,489
Fuck.

1074
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:22,084
Get-Get-Get-Get... Get down. Get down.

1075
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:23,879
- Where? Where?
- Jesus Christ.

1076
00:58:40,646 --> 00:58:42,856
Tell me about those healthy boundaries.

1077
00:58:44,399 --> 00:58:47,276
I'm doing my job. I'm here for Rory.

1078
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:54,408
Did you lose a patient? Is that it?

1079
00:58:54,409 --> 00:58:55,536
Be quiet.

1080
00:58:57,704 --> 00:58:59,331
Yeah.

1081
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:01,874
- No, I get it.
- You don't know anything.

1082
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:03,334
- These guys see so many things.
- Stop talking.

1083
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:05,461
- They come back here, they lose hope.
- You run your mouth so much.

1084
00:59:05,462 --> 00:59:06,796
- No one's around to help.
- I don't understand how you survived

1085
00:59:06,797 --> 00:59:08,172
- as long as you have.
- I'm not running my mouth.

1086
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:10,175
Be quiet. Quiet.

1087
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:16,264
Let me ask you a question.

1088
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:17,391
What's wrong with me?

1089
00:59:19,726 --> 00:59:21,727
No, I'm serious. I really wanna know.

1090
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:25,439
Adult disinhibited
social engagement disorder.

1091
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,360
Probably stemming from an early childhood
disrupted attachment complex.

1092
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:31,321
You feel abandoned by people.

1093
00:59:36,577 --> 00:59:37,827
Nah, that's not it.

1094
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:41,706
You're more comfortable
feeling abandoned and alone.

1095
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:45,335
When someone tells you the truth,
you talk so you don't have to hear it.

1096
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:49,422
You know, I'm starting to understand why
so many of your patients shoot themselves.

1097
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:53,010
Cobby, if you want a friend, be a friend.

1098
01:00:03,228 --> 01:00:05,272
Hello, Frank. How are you doing?

1099
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,623
I think it's the cops.

1100
01:00:27,252 --> 01:00:29,254
Tell Cobby to get his ass up here.

1101
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:35,468
You whipped up a shit storm
for yourself now, kid.

1102
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:38,347
Mr. K...

1103
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:42,558
Would you excuse us, John?

1104
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,853
Sure thing, Frank, I'll step out.

1105
01:00:45,896 --> 01:00:47,313
Place is yours.

1106
01:00:47,314 --> 01:00:49,065
I'll try not to make a mess.

1107
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:51,235
You do whatever you want, Frank.

1108
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:53,278
I got insurance.

1109
01:00:54,738 --> 01:00:57,156
Well, I hope you got insurance
on your beach house too.

1110
01:00:57,157 --> 01:00:58,991
I tried to help you, Cobby.

1111
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:00,869
God knows I tried.

1112
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:08,585
Sit.

1113
01:01:10,963 --> 01:01:12,214
I have a gun.

1114
01:01:13,298 --> 01:01:15,175
You're going to shoot someone with it?

1115
01:01:17,261 --> 01:01:18,303
No.

1116
01:01:21,431 --> 01:01:22,431
Sorry.

1117
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:32,192
You ever committed a crime before?

1118
01:01:33,235 --> 01:01:34,235
Not a felony.

1119
01:01:34,236 --> 01:01:36,612
Sir, if I can
speak on behalf of these two men...

1120
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:37,613
No, you may not.

1121
01:01:37,614 --> 01:01:38,824
Who are you?

1122
01:01:40,576 --> 01:01:42,368
- She's our hostage.
- She's our psychiatrist.

1123
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:44,579
I'm not your psychiatrist.

1124
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,705
You're underpaid.

1125
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:47,207
Yeah, no shit.

1126
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:51,378
So, this is it? We're under arrest?

1127
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:55,382
I don't think he's here to arrest us.

1128
01:01:58,719 --> 01:01:59,719
Where is it?

1129
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,763
Where is what?

1130
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:04,183
He's talking about this.

1131
01:02:07,853 --> 01:02:08,853
Let me ask you something.

1132
01:02:10,981 --> 01:02:14,261
Why would a mayor care so much about this
that he sends someone like you to get it?

1133
01:02:14,902 --> 01:02:16,278
It's not my business.

1134
01:02:16,862 --> 01:02:19,907
Which means
it's definitely not your business.

1135
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:29,999
Look, lady. You walk out with me.

1136
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,667
But I'm their hostage.

1137
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:33,045
And I'm saving you.

1138
01:02:34,046 --> 01:02:37,633
Hands on the bar when
the C-11 wagon boys come in here.

1139
01:02:38,383 --> 01:02:41,136
They're armed,
and they drink a lot of coffee.

1140
01:03:08,247 --> 01:03:10,665
- They're not going anywhere.
- Move, move, move.

1141
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:12,083
- Back off.
- You back off.

1142
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:13,669
Let Boston PD handle this.

1143
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:18,298
The fuck are you doing?

1144
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:21,259
He said hands on the bar.
I'm putting my hands on the fucking bar.

1145
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,052
You don't smell it?

1146
01:03:23,053 --> 01:03:24,428
Smell what?

1147
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:28,684
Shit.

1148
01:03:29,309 --> 01:03:30,434
What are we waiting for?

1149
01:03:30,435 --> 01:03:31,602
Did we miss it?

1150
01:03:31,603 --> 01:03:33,062
Go, go, go!

1151
01:03:43,699 --> 01:03:45,826
Get the Quincy fire department here.

1152
01:03:55,377 --> 01:03:57,004
Must be a fire someplace.

1153
01:03:58,839 --> 01:03:59,839
Big one.

1154
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:02,718
Like a five-alarm.

1155
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:08,098
What do we do now?

1156
01:04:15,063 --> 01:04:16,440
We're going to Montreal.

1157
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:20,610
- Montreal?
- Yeah, Montreal.

1158
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:22,361
We'll be safe there.

1159
01:04:22,362 --> 01:04:24,698
Okay. Why?

1160
01:04:26,158 --> 01:04:27,242
It's in Canada.

1161
01:04:27,784 --> 01:04:29,411
Yeah, no, I know where it is. But...

1162
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:32,247
Do you know someone there?

1163
01:04:32,915 --> 01:04:33,915
Nah.

1164
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:35,746
How are we gonna get there?

1165
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:38,503
Take the highway.

1166
01:04:38,504 --> 01:04:40,544
- Just follow the signs.
- With everyone chasing us?

1167
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:43,132
How are we gonna cross the border?

1168
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:44,092
I don't know, guy.

1169
01:04:44,093 --> 01:04:46,594
We're gonna fucking park at Niagara Falls,
and we're gonna hike across.

1170
01:04:46,595 --> 01:04:48,554
It's like negative 50 up there.

1171
01:04:48,555 --> 01:04:50,181
There's like 20 feet of snow.

1172
01:04:50,182 --> 01:04:51,349
Dead of winter?

1173
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:55,895
You need a fucking dogsled and a pack
of huskies to get across the border.

1174
01:04:55,896 --> 01:04:57,731
You gonna walk across in sneakers?

1175
01:05:00,317 --> 01:05:03,195
- Have you ever been to Montreal?
- No, I haven't been to Montreal.

1176
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:04,987
What difference does that make?

1177
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:06,907
Montreal's a terrible idea.

1178
01:05:07,533 --> 01:05:09,242
- Montreal's a terrible idea?
- Terrible.

1179
01:05:09,243 --> 01:05:10,993
Yeah, Montreal's a terrible idea.

1180
01:05:12,663 --> 01:05:14,957
Ev... So everybody's wrong about Montreal.

1181
01:05:18,168 --> 01:05:19,253
You ever robbed a bank?

1182
01:05:22,297 --> 01:05:23,297
What?

1183
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:27,385
Rob a bank.

1184
01:05:27,386 --> 01:05:28,470
You're not robbing a bank.

1185
01:05:29,137 --> 01:05:30,305
I need the money.

1186
01:05:31,932 --> 01:05:33,099
How are you gonna rob a bank?

1187
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,268
- How?
- Yeah.

1188
01:05:34,977 --> 01:05:36,769
Walk in. Put a mask on.

1189
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:38,855
Put the mask on after y-you walk in?

1190
01:05:38,856 --> 01:05:40,189
Or before?

1191
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:41,816
Before.

1192
01:05:41,817 --> 01:05:43,609
What about the armed guards?

1193
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:44,944
What about the time lock on the vault?

1194
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:47,822
What about the fact they don't have
more than two grand in any of the drawers?

1195
01:05:47,823 --> 01:05:49,115
Never mind the big safe.

1196
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:50,868
You just gonna get shot for nothing.

1197
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:53,661
Robbing a bank is a terrible idea.
We're going to Montreal.

1198
01:05:53,662 --> 01:05:55,830
Montreal solves none of my problems. None.

1199
01:05:55,831 --> 01:05:57,708
Yeah, well,
I'm not going back to jail again.

1200
01:06:03,505 --> 01:06:04,756
Have fun in Montreal.

1201
01:06:05,507 --> 01:06:06,884
Have fun robbing a bank.

1202
01:06:31,742 --> 01:06:37,122
18, 13, 87, 18, 20, 26, 71, 29, 80.

1203
01:06:38,498 --> 01:06:40,626
Those are the numbers
on the mayor's bracelet.

1204
01:06:41,752 --> 01:06:43,837
You want $32,480?

1205
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:45,630
Yeah.

1206
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:54,765
Miccelli's gotta go!

1207
01:07:09,238 --> 01:07:11,365
Twenty-five years of kickbacks and bribes.

1208
01:07:12,407 --> 01:07:15,285
The mayor's probably sitting on
more cash than the Shah of Iran.

1209
01:07:16,328 --> 01:07:18,371
You send Frank Toomey
to get your bracelet,

1210
01:07:18,372 --> 01:07:19,830
you better believe it's worth something.

1211
01:07:19,831 --> 01:07:22,041
Those numbers are
the combination to his safe,

1212
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:24,482
and the safe's in his office,
and that's why he ain't leaving.

1213
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,881
So, you're saying you
wanna rob the mayor again?

1214
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:31,635
I'm not saying it went so well
the first time, but...

1215
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:35,472
but they would never think
we'd be dumb enough to do it again.

1216
01:07:39,726 --> 01:07:42,606
Everyone's going to
fucking jail unless we get it out of here.

1217
01:07:43,981 --> 01:07:46,774
Just get that fucking safe
onto the fucking dolly

1218
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:48,277
and get it out of this office!

1219
01:07:51,321 --> 01:07:53,155
Mayor won't forget you, Frank.

1220
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:55,316
- Put your asses into it, guys.
- I got it, sir.

1221
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:57,285
- You goddamn pussies!
- I got it!

1222
01:07:58,704 --> 01:08:00,205
Clean up crime!

1223
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:07,253
Miccelli's gotta go!

1224
01:08:07,254 --> 01:08:09,756
Clean up crime!

1225
01:08:23,645 --> 01:08:25,271
You think they keep
the keys in these things?

1226
01:08:25,272 --> 01:08:28,149
We came here for suits.
Now you wanna take the fucking truck?

1227
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:31,938
Don't you think it would be
fun to steal a fire truck?

1228
01:08:40,703 --> 01:08:42,747
- Fire department.
- Boston Fire.

1229
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:48,920
- Boston Fire Department.
- Boston Fire.

1230
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:50,380
Boston Fire.

1231
01:08:59,096 --> 01:09:00,496
Do you know where that goes?

1232
01:09:01,808 --> 01:09:04,477
Yeah, it goes in here,
it goes across there, and up.

1233
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:06,145
Yeah, but up where? How do you know?

1234
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:09,565
It goes in the building.

1235
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:11,984
Believe me, it goes... it goes somewhere.

1236
01:09:23,372 --> 01:09:25,623
Alan, this is
my retirement plan right there.

1237
01:09:25,624 --> 01:09:27,666
Okay. Yeah.

1238
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:29,710
You feel it, baby? You feel it?

1239
01:09:29,711 --> 01:09:31,670
- <i>Fire reported.</i>
- What the fuck?

1240
01:09:31,671 --> 01:09:33,549
- <i>Please evacuate the building.</i>
- Evacuate?

1241
01:09:48,897 --> 01:09:50,941
Go that way! Come on! Come on!

1242
01:09:51,608 --> 01:09:52,609
It worked.

1243
01:10:08,834 --> 01:10:10,626
Feel how heavy these boots are?

1244
01:10:10,627 --> 01:10:13,379
If you say Montreal again,
I swear to God, I'll kill us both.

1245
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,674
Just saying. My toes are toasty.

1246
01:10:16,675 --> 01:10:19,260
<i>Fire has been
reported in the building.</i>

1247
01:10:20,429 --> 01:10:22,180
- This is not a drill, sir.
- Shit!

1248
01:10:22,181 --> 01:10:24,140
<i>Please evacuate
the building now.</i>

1249
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:26,852
I need to evacuate
you and all staff to safety.

1250
01:10:30,147 --> 01:10:31,689
Can you give me a minute?

1251
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:33,567
Sir, please, I'm just doing my job.

1252
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:38,571
- Jesus Christ.
- Now, sir!

1253
01:10:38,572 --> 01:10:40,698
What the fuck is going on over here?

1254
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:43,451
- Sir! Right now! We gotta go right now!
- Get your hands off me!

1255
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:47,079
- I'm the fucking mayor. You can't...
- Let's go! Right now, sir! Right now!

1256
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,915
Let's go! Come on!

1257
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,875
Where are you going? Hey!

1258
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:52,293
Building's on fire!

1259
01:10:52,294 --> 01:10:55,087
- Don't you leave without it, Alan.
- Right now, sir!

1260
01:10:55,088 --> 01:10:56,173
Stay safe, Alan.

1261
01:10:57,216 --> 01:10:59,176
Building's on fire.

1262
01:11:15,859 --> 01:11:18,486
I think firemen take the stairs.

1263
01:11:18,487 --> 01:11:20,030
Firemen take the stairs.

1264
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:24,535
Hey!

1265
01:11:25,619 --> 01:11:27,620
What the fuck are you two doing?

1266
01:11:27,621 --> 01:11:28,747
Hey!

1267
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:31,791
Taking the stairs like everyone else.

1268
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:33,125
Don't you walk away from me!

1269
01:11:33,126 --> 01:11:34,627
We're good. We're good. Relax!

1270
01:11:34,628 --> 01:11:35,629
Hey!

1271
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:39,842
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up? I got shot today, bro.

1272
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:42,009
Hey!

1273
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:45,347
- This guy. Fuck.
- Fuck off!

1274
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:46,849
Excuse me?

1275
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:49,977
Give me a fucking break, guy.
We-We're fighting the fire here.

1276
01:11:54,356 --> 01:11:56,649
Turn around! What am I supposed to do?

1277
01:11:56,650 --> 01:12:01,153
What the fuck is this?
I'm gonna have your job...

1278
01:12:01,154 --> 01:12:02,280
I do not have a choice.

1279
01:12:02,281 --> 01:12:04,199
Hey! Where are you going?

1280
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,535
Stay the fuck out of my office!

1281
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:09,871
- Hey!
- Fuck off!

1282
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:12,456
Hey, what did you just say to me?

1283
01:12:12,457 --> 01:12:14,668
Don't you walk away from me!

1284
01:12:15,252 --> 01:12:16,752
What do you think this is?

1285
01:12:16,753 --> 01:12:19,589
- Stop! Right now!
- He's not gonna let up.

1286
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:23,593
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Don't you close that door!

1287
01:12:23,594 --> 01:12:25,386
Don't you fuck...

1288
01:12:30,392 --> 01:12:32,351
Jesus Christ.

1289
01:12:32,352 --> 01:12:34,072
- This fucking guy.
- Un-fucking-believable.

1290
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:40,484
Come on!

1291
01:12:40,485 --> 01:12:43,906
Does everybody in this town
have to be a fucking hero?

1292
01:12:47,284 --> 01:12:48,327
I'm not a hero.

1293
01:12:49,912 --> 01:12:53,457
Hey, stop it! Stop it!

1294
01:12:56,710 --> 01:13:00,422
We got a hostage,
and he's about to go over a balcony!

1295
01:13:02,966 --> 01:13:04,259
What are you doing?

1296
01:13:06,261 --> 01:13:07,386
I'm buying time.

1297
01:13:07,387 --> 01:13:08,764
This was a robbery.

1298
01:13:09,264 --> 01:13:10,473
We were getting four to seven.

1299
01:13:10,474 --> 01:13:12,808
Now we're getting
twenty years for kidnapping.

1300
01:13:12,809 --> 01:13:14,936
There was an ax coming through the door.

1301
01:13:14,937 --> 01:13:16,270
I was improvising.

1302
01:13:16,271 --> 01:13:19,273
Worse than that,
this is a federal building.

1303
01:13:19,274 --> 01:13:23,986
Yeah, Homeland Security Act is activated.
No custodial limit for terrorists.

1304
01:13:23,987 --> 01:13:26,781
They'll have gone to red. Shoot to kill.

1305
01:13:26,782 --> 01:13:30,243
Plus...
I-I-I'm a government employee.

1306
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:32,870
So, that triggers
a whole suite of responses.

1307
01:13:32,871 --> 01:13:34,748
You triggered a suite of responses.

1308
01:13:47,594 --> 01:13:49,346
Well, the water stopped.

1309
01:13:50,097 --> 01:13:51,973
They're getting the negotiator.

1310
01:13:51,974 --> 01:13:53,614
They're not getting a...

1311
01:13:56,812 --> 01:13:58,605
That's probably the negotiator.

1312
01:14:04,027 --> 01:14:07,446
That's a really big safe.

1313
01:14:07,447 --> 01:14:09,741
Shit. What an afternoon.

1314
01:14:12,244 --> 01:14:13,578
What's going on?

1315
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:15,079
There's a big fire at city hall.

1316
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,790
Yeah. Thank goodness
those sprinklers actually work, yeah?

1317
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,668
It's chaos over there.

1318
01:14:24,715 --> 01:14:26,008
I'll have this to go.

1319
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:37,144
Who's in charge here?

1320
01:14:38,103 --> 01:14:39,103
Hey!

1321
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:41,106
Who's in charge here?

1322
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:42,900
Mr. Mayor!

1323
01:14:43,984 --> 01:14:46,694
We got a rapidly-evolving
security situation.

1324
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:48,112
You got snipers?

1325
01:14:48,113 --> 01:14:49,906
Sir, getting set up now.

1326
01:14:49,907 --> 01:14:51,824
It-It's very... It's very simple, okay?

1327
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:54,243
You take out the bad guys,
I give you a fucking parade.

1328
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:59,458
Use your head, fellas.
Let's take 'em down.

1329
01:15:00,042 --> 01:15:02,044
Seventy-one,

1330
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,672
twenty-nine...

1331
01:15:08,592 --> 01:15:09,593
Eighty.

1332
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:12,512
My God.

1333
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:14,389
- Yeah.
- No way.

1334
01:15:15,766 --> 01:15:17,476
Wait, wait. What?

1335
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:22,981
Holy shit.

1336
01:15:23,482 --> 01:15:26,860
You said your share was 32,480?

1337
01:15:31,823 --> 01:15:32,991
More or less.

1338
01:15:46,463 --> 01:15:48,965
Excuse me. Officer.

1339
01:15:48,966 --> 01:15:50,133
Officer!

1340
01:15:51,927 --> 01:15:53,970
I wanna make a deal and turn state's.

1341
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:55,722
Not now, Alan.

1342
01:15:56,348 --> 01:15:57,766
Kind of in the middle of something.

1343
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:05,941
I want immunity from prosecution
in exchange for full cooperation.

1344
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:13,281
Twenty years of evidence.

1345
01:16:13,282 --> 01:16:18,202
Kickbacks, bribes,
u-untraceable offshore bank accounts.

1346
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,956
You know we're not cops, right?

1347
01:16:21,957 --> 01:16:23,208
We're not even firemen.

1348
01:16:24,001 --> 01:16:28,255
I want you to witness
I cooperated as soon as I could.

1349
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:32,801
Well done.

1350
01:16:37,139 --> 01:16:38,849
Fucking heroes everywhere.

1351
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:44,020
Dude, is that the M82A1?

1352
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:46,689
Fuck yeah, it is. They won't
even let me use it at the range.

1353
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:50,401
Throw me a slice.

1354
01:16:50,402 --> 01:16:51,612
Throw me a beer, Joe.

1355
01:16:54,198 --> 01:16:55,823
Let's fuck them up.

1356
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:57,367
What are we waiting for?

1357
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,080
It's Waco out there.

1358
01:17:02,623 --> 01:17:04,666
Hey, Bobby Orr signed this stick.

1359
01:17:05,209 --> 01:17:07,960
Yeah, that's probably fake.
They're mostly fakes.

1360
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,962
Yeah, I saw him play. Saw his last game.

1361
01:17:09,963 --> 01:17:11,839
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1362
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,299
How fucking old are you?

1363
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,426
I... I was, like, seven.

1364
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:20,224
Bobby's knees were shot.
He played like shit. But I was there.

1365
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:23,518
Yeah, he told me not to forget it.

1366
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:26,062
Bobby Orr told you don't forget his game?

1367
01:17:26,063 --> 01:17:28,565
No, no. Not Bobby Orr. My father took me.

1368
01:17:31,068 --> 01:17:32,985
<i>Sierra team one
has a clean shot.</i>

1369
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:34,112
Watch out!

1370
01:17:36,823 --> 01:17:38,867
Light 'em up, boys! Let's go!

1371
01:17:43,247 --> 01:17:44,247
Shit.

1372
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:48,126
Go, go!

1373
01:17:49,169 --> 01:17:50,211
Out my fucking way!

1374
01:17:50,212 --> 01:17:51,879
Stop firing! SWAT team!

1375
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,173
There's a hostage inside. Stop firing!

1376
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:56,300
That's what I'm talking about!

1377
01:17:56,301 --> 01:17:57,510
Stay away from the window!

1378
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:02,641
Christ! Fuck!

1379
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:06,395
Stop firing. Stop fucking firing!

1380
01:18:07,271 --> 01:18:09,356
Shit! Jesus! Jesus!

1381
01:18:10,983 --> 01:18:12,900
- Are you hit?
- Yes.

1382
01:18:12,901 --> 01:18:14,360
You are?

1383
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:15,403
You mean gunshot?

1384
01:18:15,404 --> 01:18:16,487
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1385
01:18:16,488 --> 01:18:18,156
Fuck. Where?

1386
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:21,200
Well, my arm hurts.
I think it's... I think it's a hit.

1387
01:18:21,201 --> 01:18:22,410
You already got hit in the arm.

1388
01:18:22,411 --> 01:18:24,370
I don't know, just give me a minute.
I just landed.

1389
01:18:24,371 --> 01:18:26,831
Who gave the order to stop firing?

1390
01:18:26,832 --> 01:18:28,958
I didn't give any fucking order.

1391
01:18:28,959 --> 01:18:31,127
Your lawyer's in there, sir.

1392
01:18:31,128 --> 01:18:33,338
Who? Alan? Yeah.

1393
01:18:39,178 --> 01:18:41,137
<i>Negotiator's going in.</i>

1394
01:18:41,138 --> 01:18:42,680
You know what to do?

1395
01:18:42,681 --> 01:18:44,473
Yeah.

1396
01:18:44,474 --> 01:18:46,642
- Yeah. It's a gunshot.
- Not a chance.

1397
01:18:46,643 --> 01:18:48,019
- It's a bullet wound.
- There's no way.

1398
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,312
What do you think it is? A charley horse?

1399
01:18:49,313 --> 01:18:51,953
You got a rip in your sweatshirt
from crawling around on the floor.

1400
01:18:52,524 --> 01:18:54,609
Here's a solve for you.
A needle and thread.

1401
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:55,902
That's what fixes your problem.

1402
01:18:55,903 --> 01:18:58,779
Being the only guy who was shot
today before, I think I would know.

1403
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:00,199
No one got hit.

1404
01:19:01,033 --> 01:19:03,201
- What do you think that is?
- It's not a gunshot.

1405
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:05,620
- A guy takes a bullet for you.
- You took a bullet for me?

1406
01:19:05,621 --> 01:19:07,747
You could have caught that on the couch
when you came around the corner.

1407
01:19:07,748 --> 01:19:09,415
I got shot twice today,
and I'd like to have it acknowledged.

1408
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:10,541
Why do you think it's a gun...

1409
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:11,919
It's a scratch.

1410
01:19:16,089 --> 01:19:17,090
Occupied.

1411
01:19:18,383 --> 01:19:22,513
Rory. Rory, it's me. Dr. Rivera.

1412
01:19:24,389 --> 01:19:25,389
I'm alone.

1413
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:28,018
Hang on.

1414
01:19:42,908 --> 01:19:44,826
- Hi.
- Hi.

1415
01:19:45,494 --> 01:19:46,495
Can I come in?

1416
01:19:50,123 --> 01:19:51,123
Hiya, Doc.

1417
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:53,042
Are you guys okay?

1418
01:19:53,043 --> 01:19:54,795
Yeah. We're great.

1419
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:58,297
Well, unfortunately, I got shot. Again.

1420
01:19:58,298 --> 01:19:59,757
He didn't get shot.

1421
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:01,884
- Yes, I did.
- You the negotiator?

1422
01:20:01,885 --> 01:20:03,636
Yes, I-I-I am.

1423
01:20:03,637 --> 01:20:08,182
Mayor's counsel, Alan Flynn.
I'm, cooperating.

1424
01:20:08,183 --> 01:20:12,145
Alan's our new hostage,
but we don't like him more than you.

1425
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:15,941
Hi, Alan.

1426
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:20,112
I like that vest. You look nice.

1427
01:20:29,788 --> 01:20:31,456
What is going on, Rory?

1428
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:37,086
I'm getting my $32,480.

1429
01:20:40,716 --> 01:20:41,716
How are you feeling?

1430
01:20:42,384 --> 01:20:44,011
Good. Fine.

1431
01:21:01,236 --> 01:21:02,904
This how this kind of thing normally goes?

1432
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:05,407
Cobby, please don't interrupt.

1433
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:09,328
But, no, normally
the patient answers the question.

1434
01:21:11,038 --> 01:21:12,788
You have the money.
You got what you wanted.

1435
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:14,416
Does it feel like you thought it would?

1436
01:21:30,557 --> 01:21:33,226
I can take the money to your son.
I'll put it under my bulletproof vest.

1437
01:21:33,227 --> 01:21:34,895
Walk out of here and take it to him.

1438
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:37,772
You did it.

1439
01:21:37,773 --> 01:21:40,108
You can... What was it?
"Punch your ticket."

1440
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,281
So, what are you feeling?

1441
01:21:53,247 --> 01:21:54,790
I don't wanna die.

1442
01:22:01,255 --> 01:22:02,548
I don't wanna die.

1443
01:22:06,426 --> 01:22:08,470
That took a lot of courage to say that.

1444
01:22:09,304 --> 01:22:10,722
I'm really proud of you.

1445
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:15,811
Yes, Cobby.

1446
01:22:16,895 --> 01:22:19,064
I also don't wanna die.

1447
01:22:20,649 --> 01:22:22,150
That's good, Cobby.

1448
01:22:22,818 --> 01:22:24,945
I don't wanna die.

1449
01:22:25,821 --> 01:22:27,322
Alan, you're not a part of this.

1450
01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:29,533
Okay.

1451
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:35,080
I'm ready to turn myself in.

1452
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:40,252
Are you crazy?
You turn yourself in, they'll kill you.

1453
01:22:41,795 --> 01:22:43,129
You have to run.

1454
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:46,382
Wait. All you've been saying,
like, from the very beginning was...

1455
01:22:46,383 --> 01:22:48,050
Please, I've been
saying that from the start.

1456
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:50,178
What do you want me to say?
I was... I was wrong?

1457
01:22:50,179 --> 01:22:51,637
- Yes. I'd like that.
- No, that's...

1458
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:54,182
- I mean, is that so hard?
- Okay. Yeah. Okay. I was wrong.

1459
01:22:54,183 --> 01:22:57,393
Fuck.

1460
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:00,771
What?

1461
01:23:02,441 --> 01:23:04,568
I think I wanna go to Montreal.

1462
01:23:08,614 --> 01:23:10,895
<i>Male and female subjects
exiting the building.</i>

1463
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:20,374
Are they coming out?

1464
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:22,544
Sir, yes, sir. They certainly are.

1465
01:23:23,128 --> 01:23:24,254
All right.

1466
01:23:36,725 --> 01:23:38,184
It was good while it lasted.

1467
01:23:38,185 --> 01:23:40,062
Fuck, that was heavy.

1468
01:23:50,864 --> 01:23:51,864
Not mine.

1469
01:23:57,996 --> 01:24:01,541
Stop! Pull back! Stay back! Stay back!

1470
01:24:04,837 --> 01:24:06,588
Stop! Stop!

1471
01:24:39,997 --> 01:24:41,039
Clear, clear, clear!

1472
01:24:44,418 --> 01:24:47,295
- Hey!
- Bye. Yep. We're firemen. Goodbye.

1473
01:24:47,296 --> 01:24:49,213
- Good night.
- Holy shit.

1474
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:51,048
- Holy shit!
- My God.

1475
01:24:51,049 --> 01:24:53,301
What did I tell you? What did I tell you?

1476
01:24:53,302 --> 01:24:56,304
- You were not wrong. You were not wrong.
- Is being firemen a good idea?

1477
01:24:56,305 --> 01:24:58,556
<i>We're going to Montreal. Let's go.</i>

1478
01:24:58,557 --> 01:25:00,683
<i>- Let's go!
- Montreal. Montreal! Let's go!</i>

1479
01:25:00,684 --> 01:25:02,935
Who's driving that fire truck?

1480
01:25:02,936 --> 01:25:05,855
They take one look at this fire truck,
they're gonna let us right in.

1481
01:25:05,856 --> 01:25:08,232
Coming through. Move aside. Move aside.

1482
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:09,859
<i>American heroes coming through, please.</i>

1483
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:11,694
- How many miles to Montreal?
- Three hundred, give or take.

1484
01:25:11,695 --> 01:25:13,779
How many miles to freedom?
We're going to Montreal!

1485
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:16,115
- Montreal.
- <i>We're going to Montreal in a fire truck!</i>

1486
01:25:16,116 --> 01:25:17,909
There's nothing
that's stopping this truck.

1487
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:19,076
Nothing. Nothing!

1488
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:21,955
Fu... Shit.

1489
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,668
Car! Car! Car! Bro! Car!
You're hitting the cars over here.

1490
01:25:27,461 --> 01:25:29,922
- Shit! He's coming.
- Come on. Go!

1491
01:25:31,757 --> 01:25:34,133
Go. Go. Go!
Speed up! Speed up! Come on!

1492
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:36,552
- I am. I am speeding up. I'm speeding up!
- You're going slower!

1493
01:25:36,553 --> 01:25:38,137
- Put it in gear.
- It's in gear.

1494
01:25:38,138 --> 01:25:40,378
- It's going as fast as it can.
- Put it in another gear!

1495
01:25:42,351 --> 01:25:45,395
Push! Push!

1496
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:50,900
He's such an asshole.

1497
01:25:50,901 --> 01:25:53,445
- Speed up! Speed up!
- I am! I am!

1498
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:57,240
- Try to counter steer!
- I am counter steering!

1499
01:25:57,241 --> 01:25:59,784
- Steer the other way!
- I'm trying to counter steer!

1500
01:25:59,785 --> 01:26:01,119
Fuck me!

1501
01:26:14,174 --> 01:26:16,385
Shit!

1502
01:26:19,137 --> 01:26:20,721
Your door. Your door.

1503
01:26:20,722 --> 01:26:22,849
- I can't get it... It's jammed.
- Your way. Open the door.

1504
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:24,350
It's just a latch. It's a simple la...

1505
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:26,228
There he is.

1506
01:26:27,688 --> 01:26:29,606
Hands up, motherfuckers.

1507
01:26:31,149 --> 01:26:32,943
Are you out of your fucking minds?

1508
01:26:34,278 --> 01:26:36,405
We are in treatment. Yeah.

1509
01:26:36,905 --> 01:26:38,907
Get out.
Put your hands up against the truck.

1510
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:42,493
Sir, I'm in possession of something

1511
01:26:42,494 --> 01:26:44,538
I think you're gonna find
very interesting.

1512
01:26:46,164 --> 01:26:47,165
What?

1513
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:50,335
May I put my hand into my pocket
and pull it out?

1514
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:55,674
This right here
is 20 years of kickbacks and bribes.

1515
01:26:56,508 --> 01:27:00,137
Now, we would be willing
to trade this to you for our freedom.

1516
01:27:03,307 --> 01:27:05,516
What I propose is that
you put this in your pocket,

1517
01:27:05,517 --> 01:27:07,978
you turn around, and you walk away.

1518
01:27:08,729 --> 01:27:10,271
You never work another day in your life,

1519
01:27:10,272 --> 01:27:12,399
- and we're gone. That's it.
- Gone. We're gone.

1520
01:27:19,615 --> 01:27:23,076
Free health care,
free dental work,

1521
01:27:23,827 --> 01:27:28,790
haircuts, men's groups, "de-licing."

1522
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:31,960
You get your steps in.

1523
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:34,254
Never lose your wallet.

1524
01:27:36,507 --> 01:27:37,591
Marriage.

1525
01:27:38,258 --> 01:27:39,343
Already tried it.

1526
01:27:40,469 --> 01:27:41,595
Not to me.

1527
01:27:44,848 --> 01:27:46,642
Never have to pick out an outfit again.

1528
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:49,353
Like Einstein.

1529
01:27:50,646 --> 01:27:52,689
Tell me that guy
didn't know a thing or two.

1530
01:27:55,692 --> 01:28:00,696
<i>73 to Montreal is now ready
to begin preliminary boarding at gate...</i>

1531
01:28:00,697 --> 01:28:02,032
Mayor Miccelli?

1532
01:28:06,078 --> 01:28:07,246
Who, me?

1533
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:11,123
Mr. Mayor, I would like to say

1534
01:28:11,124 --> 01:28:15,754
I am very supportive
of your anti-corruption platform.

1535
01:28:16,296 --> 01:28:18,631
So, when we prosecute
these two men from Quincy,

1536
01:28:18,632 --> 01:28:23,679
their lawyers, of course,
will enter into evidence these hard drives

1537
01:28:24,763 --> 01:28:26,223
and the accounts listed on them,

1538
01:28:27,015 --> 01:28:30,935
which contain
100 million untraceable dollars.

1539
01:28:30,936 --> 01:28:36,649
So, we will be returning 100 million
untraceable dollars to the state

1540
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:38,277
that we could otherwise...

1541
01:28:40,821 --> 01:28:42,981
Mr. Mayor,
if you could look right here.

1542
01:28:44,908 --> 01:28:48,661
But, Mr. Mayor,
if we did not prosecute these two men,

1543
01:28:48,662 --> 01:28:52,249
then these drives would not be
entered into evidence.

1544
01:28:59,173 --> 01:29:02,593
All right, it's your lucky day.
Out! Let's go.

1545
01:29:03,218 --> 01:29:04,969
Come on, buddy. Let's go, go, go, go.

1546
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:06,053
Watch your head.

1547
01:29:06,054 --> 01:29:08,723
Down. You too. Let's go.
Let's go. Here you go. Down.

1548
01:29:08,724 --> 01:29:10,850
Step and down, hold.

1549
01:29:10,851 --> 01:29:12,602
Happy holidays, boys.

1551
01:29:15,147 --> 01:29:16,732
Hope you make the most of it.

1552
01:29:21,737 --> 01:29:23,487
Hey, we had some boots.

1553
01:29:23,488 --> 01:29:25,532
Yeah, those were
returned to the fire department.

1554
01:29:26,241 --> 01:29:30,369
Yeah, but there were some,
personal effects inside the boots.

1555
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:32,623
The cash? Yeah, we took that.

1556
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,626
Much appreciated.

1557
01:29:37,461 --> 01:29:39,420
I don't kn... What just happened?

1558
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:42,174
- What just... What?
- Keep walking. Just keep walking.

1559
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:46,177
So, we're just... w-we're free?

1560
01:29:46,178 --> 01:29:48,930
- Yeah.
- We're free. Wow.

1561
01:29:48,931 --> 01:29:50,140
That Mark Choi?

1562
01:29:52,226 --> 01:29:54,101
I told you. Hell of a candidate.

1563
01:29:54,102 --> 01:29:57,689
I gotta say,
I didn't see that choice coming.

1564
01:29:58,524 --> 01:29:59,732
I see you, Choi.

1565
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:01,860
Choi chose to count his change.

1566
01:30:03,737 --> 01:30:05,656
Never got you to laugh, did I?

1567
01:30:07,407 --> 01:30:08,283
Yeah, you did.

1568
01:30:08,284 --> 01:30:09,659
I don't remember you laughing.

1569
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:11,536
- I laughed.
- I made a lot of jokes.

1570
01:30:11,537 --> 01:30:13,412
- I don't remember you laughing at one.
- I did laugh.

1571
01:30:13,413 --> 01:30:14,997
When did you laugh?

1572
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:16,542
Second time you got shot.

1573
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:22,171
I swear to God.

1574
01:30:28,554 --> 01:30:30,222
- Hey.
- What?

1575
01:30:31,265 --> 01:30:32,641
Never mind.

1576
01:30:33,517 --> 01:30:34,977
You be good.

1577
01:30:35,894 --> 01:30:37,437
Yeah, you be good.

1578
01:30:42,234 --> 01:30:45,027
<i>No alcohol detected.
Vehicle unlocked.</i>

1579
01:31:19,938 --> 01:31:20,772
You're loitering.

1580
01:31:20,773 --> 01:31:22,453
Yeah, well, you know how to call the cops.

1581
01:33:39,203 --> 01:33:40,203
Whoa.

1582
01:33:42,956 --> 01:33:44,541
What the fuck?

1583
01:33:49,922 --> 01:33:50,923
Needed boots.
